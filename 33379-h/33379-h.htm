<h2>PREFACE TO SECOND REVISED EDITION</h2>


<p>The old order of things is passing. The keynote of to-day&rsquo;s
work is prevention, rather than cure, children are
taught to eat correctly that they may grow into the strong,
healthy men and women which are needed to make any nation
great. This instilling of good health habits must rest
upon the nurse, the nutrition worker, the physician and
the home-maker. Close co&ouml;peration is necessary among
these workers and a definite understanding of the way to
accomplish the best results, in this respect, must come
from the training of those who are undertaking this all important
work.</p>

<p>The present revision of this text is the outgrowth of several
years of close attention to the progress, changes and
adjustments which are being made daily in this important
subject of nutrition. The changes made in this revised edition
are all in the line of constructive teaching. The material
has been reorganized that no time may be lost in a
search for the proper word to illustrate a definite point.
The method of project teaching used in this edition, is
not a new one, although the name may possibly be unfamiliar
to some. Every good teacher recognizes the value
of motivation as a means of getting an idea &ldquo;across.&rdquo; The
revision of this text was undertaken with the idea of leading
the student to think for herself and to put into practice
the scientific facts learned in class room and ward.</p>

<p>The author is indebted to many of her colleagues for
the encouragement and constructive criticism which enabled
her to make the changes which will, it is hoped and
believed, materially aid the student nurse in the study of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>viii]</a></span>
Dietetics. She also wishes to express her appreciation for
the many helpful suggestions made by her co-workers in
this respect, especially to Misses L. H. Gillett and L. Willson
for valuable criticism and to Miss H. Buquo for assistance
in the preparation of the manuscript.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION</h2>


<p>No other science has so much to do with the general
welfare of mankind as the study of food and its effects in
the human body. When we use the term &ldquo;dietetics&rdquo; as
representing &ldquo;the effect of the food in the human body,&rdquo;
we do so in a very broad sense, for the subject is a big one,
requiring comprehensive terms to express it.</p>

<p>The problems of nutrition are many. Food alone is no
small subject and a still greater one is the utilization of food
materials in such a way that the body may gain the greatest
value with the least expenditure of vital forces. These
problems are discussed in this text and the methods of overcoming
them are given in the simplest possible language.
For this purpose the subject of nutrition has been divided
into groups: (1) a comprehensive study of the sources of
food, its composition and nutritive value; (2) the effect of
food in the body under normal conditions, as in health; and
(3) its behavior and effect when conditions in the body
become abnormal, as in disease. In this way much of the
non-essential material is eliminated from the course of
study and only that included which it is necessary for the
nurse to understand and which she will constantly use both
in the hospital and later on in the practice of her profession.
The simple methods of study presented in this text are given
with the idea of avoiding confusion in the mind of the average
pupil nurse by fitting in the course with her other
studies rather than by making it stand out as a separate
subject. In this way she will be able to see at a glance the
connection between the body processes and the materials
which are used to carry them on. Thus her study of physiology,
anatomy and bacteriology go hand in hand with that
of dietetics, each bearing a distinct relationship to the others.</p>

<h2><a name="chap01" id="chap01"></a>CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
FOOD</h2>


<p>The value of a knowledge of food and its effect in the
human body cannot be overestimated. In health, this
knowledge leads to higher standards, since by pointing out
the errors in one&rsquo;s mode of living, good health habits may
be established, which will, undoubtedly assure the individual
of a better nourished and a more vigorous body.</p>

<p>There is no question as to the value of health either from
the standpoint of comfort or of economy. And the knowledge
which will enable one to spread the good work intelligently
cannot but raise the standards of living throughout
the entire community.</p>

<p>In taking up the study of dietetics, the student is introduced
to some of the fundamental principles governing the
health and well-being of a people, since dietetics includes a
study of food and its relation to the body.</p>

<p>The relationship between right food and good health is
very close; how close is being demonstrated constantly in
experimental fields of scientific research.</p>

<p>To be able to judge whether the food one eats daily is
giving the best possible value from a physiological and
economic standpoint, requires a definite knowledge of food,
its source, composition and nutrient value, as well as its
relation to the body in health and disease.</p>

<p>No one is capable of giving constructive advice upon
matters pertaining to diet, unless he has acquired this
knowledge through training. A nurse should obtain this
training during her course in the hospital, through the class
room, the wards and the diet kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
The dividing line between health and disease is frequently
almost imperceptible, and without a knowledge
of the normal body, it is, at times, impossible to tell where
the normal leaves off and the abnormal begins. For this
reason a nurse must understand normal nutrition, that is,
the behavior of food in the healthy body, before undertaking
the task of ministering to the body attacked by
disease.</p>

<p>In a text of this kind, it is impossible to cover all
phases of the subject, especially since day by day new
discoveries are being made with relation to food and its
uses in the body. But with careful attention to the principles
set forth, a nurse should be able to carry out the
dietary orders given her by the physician and dietitian in
the hospital. And, when her course of training is finished,
she should find herself equipped to assist in raising the
standard of health through her knowledge of dietetics. With
this brief summary of the aims and object of the study of
dietetics, we will begin the actual work with a study of
Food.</p>

<p><strong>Food Materials.</strong>&mdash;Food is the name given to any substance
which, taken into the body, is capable of performing
one or more of the following functions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Building and repairing tissue, maintenance, growth,
and development of the muscles, bones, nerves, and the
blood.</p>

<p>2. Furnishing the energy for the internal and external
work of the body.</p>

<p>3. Regulating the body processes, maintaining the
proper alkalinity and acidity of the various fluids throughout
the body, regulating the proper degree of temperature,
and determining the osmotic pressure, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>For the convenience of study scientists have arranged
the foodstuffs in groups:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
1. According to type;</p>

<p>2. According to their chemical composition;</p>

<p>3. According to the function they perform in the body.</p>
</div>

<p>All foods are composed of certain chemical elements;
namely, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus,
iron, magnesium, potassium, chlorine, sodium, calcium,
with traces of various others. The manner in which
these elements are combined and the amounts in which
they occur determine the group to which the combination
belongs, and give to the foodstuff its characteristic position
in human nutrition.</p>


<h3>COMPOSITION OF THE FOODSTUFFS</h3>

<p>The chemical elements are combined in food and in the
body, as: (<i>a</i>) carbohydrates, composed of carbon, oxygen
and hydrogen; (<i>b</i>) fats, composed of carbon, oxygen and
hydrogen; (<i>c</i>) proteins, composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen,
nitrogen and sulphur; (<i>d</i>) water, composed of
hydrogen and oxygen; (<i>e</i>) mineral salts. The first three
foodstuffs constitute the Organic Food group. The last two
include the remaining chemical elements, calcium, phosphorus,
sodium, potassium, chlorine, magnesium, iron and
traces of others which make up the Inorganic Food group.</p>

<p>Each of the foodstuffs belonging to the organic group
is capable of being burned in the body to produce heat for:
(<i>a</i>) the maintenance of the body temperature; (<i>b</i>) internal
and external work.</p>

<p>Neither water nor mineral salts alone can be burned to
produce heat; nevertheless, they enter into the composition
and take part in every function performed by the carbohydrates,
fats and proteins; therefore one foodstuff cannot
be said to be of greater importance than another, since the
needs of nature are best met by a judicious combination of
all. However, the wear and tear of life can be more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
efficiently accounted for, and the strain upon the organism
reduced more nearly to a minimum when the various foodstuffs
are furnished in amounts which science is proving to
be necessary for the health and well-being of the organism.</p>

<p>The sixth essential food substance, the <strong>Vitamines</strong>, together
with the adjustment of the five foodstuffs just mentioned&mdash;the
amounts and types of each in the dietary
which will assure the body of the best results&mdash;has been,
and still is a subject of grave interest. Even on the most
perfect adjustment of these foodstuffs, the diet would fail
to give the desired results without the inclusion of the sixth,
or vitamine factor, which has proved to be essential for the
growth and development of the normal body, as well as for
its protection against certain deficiency diseases.</p>

<p>In order to obtain the best results from food, both from
a health and an economic standpoint, it is necessary to become
familiar with the foodstuffs as they are combined to
make up the various common food materials. One foodstuff
may be a producer of heat, but may lack certain chemical
elements which are essential to the building of tissues;
another may be able to accomplish both functions in the
body, but will prove too expensive to use as fuel, except
when it is absolutely necessary to do so. Thus, it is essential
for the nurse to understand where and how both the foodstuffs
and the vitamines occur in nature, in order to make
use of them more advantageously. The following table
gives the sources of the foodstuffs, after which a description
of the individual foodstuffs and vitamine factors will serve
to point the way to their use in the dietary:</p>

<h3>THE INDIVIDUAL FOODSTUFFS AND VITAMINE FACTORS</h3>

<p>A study of the individual foodstuffs and vitamines will
furnish the first link in the chain which constitutes our
present knowledge of dietetics.</p>


<h3>CARBOHYDRATES</h3>

<p>In the ordinary mixed diet of man, the carbohydrates
predominate, being not only the most abundant, but also
the most economical source of energy. The term carbohydrate
covers all of the simple sugars and those substances
which can be converted into simple sugars by hydrolysis;
the ones of special interest in this study are divided into
three groups, known as, Monosaccharides (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>); Disaccharides
(C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>) and Polysaccharides (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>15</sub>).</p>

<p><strong>Monosaccharides.</strong>&mdash;Glucose, Fructose and Galactose
are substances whose monosaccharide molecules contain one
sugar radical; hence they cannot be hydrolized to simpler
sugars (sugars of lower molecular weight). Those constituting
this group of sugars are all soluble, crystallizable and
diffusible substances, which do not undergo changes from
the action of the digestive enzymes, consequently these
sugars will enter the blood stream in their original form,
unless attacked by the bacteria which inhabit the stomach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
and intestinal tract. The monosaccharides are all susceptible
to alcoholic fermentation. Each member of the group
is utilized in the body for the production of glycogen and
for the maintenance of the normal glucose of the blood.</p>

<p><strong>Disaccharides.</strong>&mdash;Sucrose, Maltose and Lactose are substances
yielding, upon hydrolysis, two molecules of simple
sugar: each of these sugars is crystallizable and diffusible:
all are soluble in water, and to a less degree in alcohol&mdash;sucrose
and maltose are more soluble than lactose. When
attacked by the digestive enzymes, these sugars are changed
to monosaccharides.</p>

<p><strong>Polysaccharides.</strong>&mdash;Starch, Dextrin, Glycogen and Cellulose
are substances more complex in character than the
above-mentioned groups. They are built up of many sugar
molecules, which yield upon complete hydrolysis many
molecules of simple sugar. The polysaccharides are insoluble
in alcohol, and only soluble to a certain extent in pure
water. Some members of this group swell and become
gelatinous in the presence of moisture and heat; some become
of a colloidal form in water, and will pass through
filter paper; others remain unchanged.</p>

<p>A brief description of the various members of these different
groups of carbohydrates will assist the nurse in the
ways and means of utilizing them in the dietary to the best
advantage.</p>

<p><strong>Glucose</strong>, which is abundant in the juice of plants and
fruits, and to a more or less degree in the blood of all animals
(usually about 0.1%) occurs free in nature. This
sugar is likewise obtained from many carbohydrates, either
through the action of acids, or as the result of the digestive
enzymes, and as such becomes the principal form in which
the animal body utilizes the carbohydrates ingested. Under
normal conditions the glucose in the blood is constantly
being burned and replaced; it is only when the body loses
to a greater or less degree the ability to burn the glucose that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
it accumulates in the blood, from which it must escape by
way of the urine. There are times, such as when very large
quantities of carbohydrates are eaten at once, when glucose
will also appear in the urine; but under such circumstances
it is generally found to be merely temporary, and for this
reason, the condition is known as temporary glycosuria. As
a rule, however, the surplus of glucose absorbed, whether
it be eaten as such, or is found as the result of enzymic
action upon the other carbohydrates, is converted into glycogen
and stored in the liver and to a less extent in the
muscles. Glycogen is readily reconverted into glucose,
which is used by the body for the production of energy. It
has been estimated that over half the energy manifested
in the human body is derived from glucose, and it is in this
form that the tissues of the body will ultimately make use
of most of the carbohydrates in food. Practically all of the
fruits, and many of the vegetables, are rich in this form of
carbohydrate, but grapes contain more than any of the
other fruits, while sweet corn, onions, and unripe potatoes
contain appreciable amounts.</p>

<p><strong>Fructose.</strong>&mdash;The second member of the monosaccharide
group is more or less associated with glucose in plant and
fruit juices, and is used like that substance for the production
of glycogen in the body. Eaten as such, or produced
as the result of digestive action upon cane sugar, fructose
is changed into glycogen, chiefly upon entering the liver, and
for this reason will not be found to enter largely into the
blood of the general circulation.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Honey is the most abundant source of fructose in nature.</p>

<p><strong>Galactose.</strong>&mdash;This sugar, unlike the other members of
this group, is not found free in nature, but it is produced
as the result of hydrolysis of milk sugar, either by
enzymes or by acids. Like glucose and fructose, galactose
seems to promote the production of glycogen in the body.

Certain substances known as galactosides, which are combinations
of galactose and some substances other than carbohydrates,
are found in the nerve and brain tissues of the animal body.</p>

<p><strong>Disaccharides.</strong>&mdash;Of the second group of carbohydrates,
we are probably more familiar with sucrose, or cane sugar,
than with either of the other two, since it is in this form
that the greater part of the sugar eaten is purchased.</p>

<p><strong>Sucrose.</strong>&mdash;By far the greater part of the sugar entering
into the average dietary is manufactured from sugar and
sorghum canes, and from sugar beets; but appreciable quantities
are derived from the sugar maple and sugar palms.
Many of the sweet fruits are rich in this form of sugar; pineapples
are said to contain at least half of their solids in
sucrose; and although other fruits and vegetables do not
contain so high a percentage of this sugar, oranges, peaches,
apricots, dates, raisins, prunes, carrots and sweet potatoes
contain goodly quantities, which are associated with glucose
and fructose. Sucrose is readily hydrolized, either by acids
or enzymes. The inverting enzyme (invertase) of yeast
and sucrase of the intestinal juice, convert sucrose to fructose
and glucose, in which forms it is absorbed into the
portal blood. It is believed that when sucrose is eaten in
very large quantities, it is sometimes absorbed from the
stomach. In these cases it does not become available for
use in the body, but acts in the same manner as when injected
directly into the blood stream, being excreted unchanged
by way of the kidneys. According to Herter,
sucrose is much more susceptible to fermentation in the
stomach than either maltose or lactose; and since it has no
advantage over these sugars from a standpoint of nutrition,
they are frequently substituted for sucrose in cases where
the dangers arising from fermentation must be avoided.</p>

<p><strong>Maltose</strong> (Malt sugar) is an important constituent
of germinating grains&mdash;malt and malt products being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
formed as the result of enzymic action (amylases) on starch.
A similar action takes place in the mouth as the result of the
ptyalin in the salivary juices and in the intestines from the
action of the starch-splitting enzyme, amylopsin, in the
pancreatic juice. The maltose thus formed is further converted
into glucose by the sugar-splitting enzyme in the
intestinal juice, and in this form it is chiefly absorbed.
Maltose is also an intermediate product formed during the
manufacture of commercial glucose as the result of the boiling
of starch with dilute acids.</p>

<p><strong>Lactose</strong> (sugar of milk) is one of the most important
constituents in the milk of all mammals. In freshly
secreted human milk, lactose occurs in quantities ranging
from 6 to 7%, and in the milk of cows and goats from
4 to 5%. Lactose is much less soluble than sucrose, and
decidedly less sweet; hence, owing to this latter property,
as well as to its lack of susceptibility to fermentation, lactose
is frequently used to bring up the sugar content of
infant formulas to the desired percentage, and the diets
used in the abnormal conditions when additional energy
material is needed. During the process of digestion, lactose
is hydrolized by the lactase in the intestinal juice, yielding
one molecule of glucose and one of galactose. Like maltose,
little if any of this sugar is absorbed in its original form,
since experiments made with injections of lactose into the
blood result in the rapid and almost complete elimination
by way of the kidneys. No such results are obtained when
even large amounts of lactose are taken by way of the
mouth.</p>

<p><strong>Polysaccharides.</strong>&mdash;This group of carbohydrates is
complex in character, built up of many sugar molecules,
and upon digestion must be broken down into simple sugars
before they can be utilized by the body.</p>

<p><strong>Starch</strong> is the form in which the plant stores her supply
of carbohydrates. It is found in this form in roots and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
(mature) tubers, three-fourths of the bulk of which is made
up of this material. From one-half to three-quarters of the
solids of grains is made up of starch also. Pure starch is a
fine white powder, odorless and almost tasteless. It is insoluble
in cold water and alcohol, but changes from an insoluble
substance to a more soluble one upon the application
of heat. Upon hydrolysis starch gives first a mixture of
dextrin and maltose, then glucose alone as an end-product.
This hydrolysis may be the result of enzymic action, as
occurs upon bringing starch in contact with the ptyalin in
the saliva, or with the amylopsin in the pancreatic juice;
or it may be the result of boiling starch with acid, as is seen
in the manufacture of commercial glucose.</p>

<p><strong>Dextrin</strong>, as has already been stated, is an intermediate
product of the hydrolysis of starch by acid or enzymes.</p>

<p><strong>Glycogen</strong> is the form in which the carbohydrates are
stored in the body, just as starch is the form in which they
are stored in plants. It is found in all parts of the body,
but is especially abundant in the liver. Here it is stored
in the cell substance rather than in the nucleus. The storage
of glycogen in the human body depends largely upon
the mode of life and upon the diet. Active muscular work,
especially out of doors, uses up the store of glycogen with
great rapidity; while rest and a sedentary life promotes
its storage. The body readily converts its supply of glycogen
into glucose, the form in which the body uses the
carbohydrates for fuel.</p>

<p><strong>Cellulose</strong> is a woody, fibrous material insoluble in water
and to a certain extent impervious to the action of the
digestive enzymes. This carbohydrate constitutes the skeleton
of plants just as the bones constitute that of the animal
body. It is probable that owing to the length of time required
for this carbohydrate to be broken down in digestion,
much of it escapes oxidation entirely. Hence, it passes
down the digestive tract lending bulk to the food mass and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
thus promoting peristalsis throughout the whole of the
digestive tract.</p>

<p><strong>Organic Acids.</strong>&mdash;Certain of the carbohydrate foods
(fruits and green vegetables) contain appreciable amounts
of organic acids or their salts; oranges and lemons, for
example, are rich in citric acid; grapes contain considerable
quantities of potassium acid tartrate, apples and other fruits
have malic acid; many of the fruits have succinic acid;
a few foods contain oxalic acid, or oxalates. All of these
organic acids are burned in the body to produce energy,
with the possible exception of the oxalates, which seem to
have little, if any, food value. According to Sherman, these
organic acids have a lower fuel value, per gram, than carbohydrates,
but are reckoned as such in computing a food in
which they exist. The function of these acids is chiefly
that of neutralizing the acids formed in the body in metabolism.
Being base-forming in character, they function after
absorption and oxidation in the body as potential bases&mdash;the
base associated with the acid in their ash combining
with carbonic acid to form carbonates, which act as above
described.</p>

<p><strong>Bacterial Action upon Carbohydrates of Foods.</strong>&mdash;The
bacteria that act chiefly upon the carbohydrates belong to
the fermentative type. The substances formed as a result
of this activity are certain acids&mdash;lactic, butyric, formic,
acetic, oxalic, and possibly alcohol. Certain forms of carbohydrates
are more susceptible to bacterial fermentation than
others. Herter claims that sucrose and glucose are much
more so than lactose, maltose, or starch. The substances
thus formed through bacterial activity are not believed to
be toxic in character, but merely irritating. However, the
irritation arising from excessive fermentation in the stomach
may lead to gastric disturbances of a more or less serious
nature; hence the amount of carbohydrate taken under certain
conditions must be adjusted carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
<strong>The Effect of Heat upon Carbohydrates.</strong>&mdash;The
changes wrought in the carbohydrates as a result of heat
have already been discussed to a certain extent. It is seen
that the sucrose (cane sugar) is soluble alike in hot and
cold water; the same is true of maltose; but lactose is much
more soluble in hot water than it is in water which has not
been heated. So far as their digestibility is concerned, the
application of heat (boiling) neither increases nor decreases
the utilization of these sugars by the body.</p>

<p>With starch it is an entirely different matter. It has
been found that the application of heat, either as dry heat,
or in the presence of moisture, brings about a definite change
in the character of the foodstuff. Pure starch admixed with
water and boiled, passes into a condition of colloidal dispersion,
or semi-solution, known as starch paste (Sherman).
This is graphically illustrated in the cooking of potatoes,
in which the starch and water are mixed in nature; and in
the cooking of cereals and like starchy foods, to which water
is added in preparation for their cooking. In both cases
the application of heat adds greatly to the digestibility of
the raw material by reason of the change which is wrought
in these substances, causing them to be more readily acted
upon by enzymes in the digestive juices.</p>

<p>This solubility of carbohydrates in hot water may be
utilized in the washing of utensils in which these substances
have been prepared; thus saving much time and effort on
the part of the nurse in either the diet kitchen or in the
home.</p>


<h3>FATS</h3>

<p>The second member of the organic food group, and one
which is almost as widely distributed throughout animal
and vegetable life as the carbohydrates, is found in the fats.
This foodstuff, while composed of the same chemical elements
that go to make up the carbohydrates, contains these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
elements in different proportions; that is, fats contain less
oxygen and more hydrogen than carbohydrates.</p>

<p><strong>Typical Fats.</strong>&mdash;The fats (as already shown in the
Table on page 5) are derived from both animal and plant
life, but, like the carbohydrates, do not always occur in the
same form. Those of animal origin include:</p>

<p><strong>Adipose Tissue</strong> of man and animals, tallow of mutton,
suet, and oleo oil of beef, lard of pork.</p>

<p><strong>Phosphorized Fats</strong>, which include lecithin and lecithans,
occur abundantly in the brain and nerve tissues and to a
less extent in the cells and tissues of man, animals, and
plants of which it seems an essential part. Egg yolk is the
most abundant source of phosphorized fat in food material,
but milk likewise furnishes an appreciable amount.</p>

<p><strong>Cholesterol</strong> (fat-like substances).&mdash;&ldquo;The fatty secretions
of the sebaceous glands of man and of the higher animals
which furnish the natural oil for hair, wool and
feathers,&rdquo; (Starling), lanoline, which is a purified wool fat,
consist chiefly of cholesterol. According to Mathews,
cholesterol is an essential constituent of the blood, and is
found in the brain and in nearly all living tissues. It is
likewise believed to be the &ldquo;mother substance&rdquo; from which
bile acids are derived.</p>

<p><strong>Fat Soluble &ldquo;A.&rdquo;</strong>&mdash;The vitamine factor which occurs
dissolved in certain fats, namely, milk (whole), butter, egg
yolk, the organs of animals, and codfish liver.</p>

<p><strong>Definition of Fat.</strong>&mdash;The fats are all glycerides; that is,
they are substances made up of combinations of fatty acids
and glycerine, which constitute a definite group of chemical
compounds, certain members of which are liquid in form,
while others are solid, or semi-solid. The liquid fats are
known as fatty oils. The fatty acids in which we are chiefly
concerned in this study are: Butyric, Stearic, Oleic, and
Palmitic. Most of the common fats owe their form and
flavor to the type and amount of the various fatty acids of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
which they are composed. For example, butter is made up
of ten fatty acids; but its soft, solid form is due to the olein
and palmitin (glycerides of oleic and palmitic acids) which
it contains; and its characteristic flavor, as well as its name,
to its butyric acid content (about 5 to 6%). It is evident
that the degree of softness or hardness of a fat may be determined
chiefly by the amount of oleic acid in its composition.
Most of the common oils with which we are familiar
in food are composed chiefly of olein. Stearin (the glyceride
of stearic acid) is the hardest of the fatty acids, while palmitin,
although classed with the solid fats, is not so hard
as stearin. Lard and butter are higher in olein and palmitin
and are consequently semi-solid, while suet and tallow,
consisting chiefly of stearin, are much harder than the
other food fats.</p>

<p><strong>Characteristics of Fats.</strong>&mdash;The fats are all insoluble in
water, and only partially so in cold alcohol, but they dissolve
readily in ether. As a rule, the fat occurring in the
animal body is more or less characteristic of the species.
For example, animals that live on land have a harder fat
than those living in the water; warm blooded animals,
harder fats than cold blooded ones (fish); and carnivorous
animals, harder fats than herbivorous species.</p>

<p>Fats are lighter than water, hence will float in it. An
emulsion is a suspension of fat in a fluid, and the fat in
this case must be very finely divided and mixed with some
other material which will prevent a coalescence of the fat
globules. In milk, which is one of the best natural emulsions,
the additional substance is protein.</p>

<p><strong>Effect of Heat upon Fat.</strong>&mdash;When fats are brought to
a high temperature, the glycerine which they contain decomposes
with the production of a substance known as
acrolein, which has an irritating effect upon the mucous
membranes. It is possible that the over-heated fatty acids
add their quota to the production of irritating fumes. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
a rule, it is inadvisable to use frying as a method of preparing
food for the sick or for children. Doubtless, if every
cook understood the exact degree of heat to apply in frying,
and knew just how moist to have the food mixture which
she intended to cook in this manner, better results would
be obtained; but since the average cook knows little about
the scientific application of heat to fat or the changes
brought about thereby, it is safer to make use of other
methods of food preparation under the circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Functions of Fat.</strong>&mdash;This foodstuff undoubtedly serves
as the most compact form of fuel available to the body for
the production of energy. Weight for weight, fat furnishes
twice as much heat as the carbohydrates, and in bulk the
difference is even more striking; for example (about) two
tablespoonfuls of sugar are required to produce 100 calories,
whereas one scant tablespoonful of olive oil will produce a
like number of heat units. As a source of supply for reserve
energy in the body, fat is most valuable. This reserve
fuel is stored in the form of adipose tissues underlying the
skin and surrounding the vital organs, lending contour to
the form and protecting the organs from jars and shocks.
Distributed throughout the body, fat may be found as (<i>a</i>)
cholesterol (in the cells of the muscles, organs, and nerve
tissues), which acts as a protection against the destruction
of the red blood cells; (<i>b</i>) phosphorized fat (lecithin), the
universal distribution of which, according to Starling, seems
to indicate that it plays an important part in the metabolic
process of the cells, serving as a source of phosphorus which
is required for the building up of the complex nucleoproteins
of the cell nuclei.</p>


<h3>PROTEINS</h3>

<p>Upon investigation it was found that neither the fats
nor carbohydrates were the chief constituents of the active
tissues. It was found, in fact, that the carbohydrates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
occurred in very small quantities only in the muscles, and
that frequently the quantity of fat was likewise limited.
Other substances, containing nitrogen and sulphur in addition
to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, which were invariably
present, and which are essential constituents of all
tissues and cells, both in animals and in plants, must be
necessary to all known life. To these substances, believed
at the time to be the fundamental constituents of all tissues,
Mulder gave the name Protein, from the Greek, meaning
&ldquo;to take first place.&rdquo; Later investigations proved that,
while the proteins were essential to the building and repairing
of the tissues and cells in general, they were not
the only factors concerned in the work; that certain mineral
salts were necessary constituents of all tissues, and must
be present in order for any normal growth and development
to occur.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><strong>Composition of Proteins.</strong>&mdash;The average nitrogen content
of common proteins is about 16%; that is, in 100
grams of protein there will be approximately 16 grams of
nitrogen, or in 6.25 grams of protein there will be 1 gram
of nitrogen. To estimate the protein content of a food
when the percentage of nitrogen is known, it is necessary
simply to multiply the percentage of nitrogen present, by
the nitrogen factor, 6.25; or, if the amount of nitrogen is
desired, when the percentage of protein is given, to divide
by same factor.</p>

<p><strong>Construction of Proteins.</strong>&mdash;In plant structure the
building up of the proteins is accomplished by the plants
from inorganic substances existing in the soil and air; but
in the animal body this is not possible, because the construction
of the tissues requires the use of other proteins&mdash;the
most available ones being found in food. Each animal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
(or species) forms the proteins characteristic of its own
tissues,&mdash;while the proteins of food are similar to those
found in the body, they cannot be utilized in their original
form, but must be split into simpler substances from which
the cells of the various tissues throughout the body may
select those particularly adapted for their purpose. These
transformed substances are known as amino acids, the production
of which is a result of digestion in the digestive
tract. There are about seventeen of these acids entering
into the construction of the common proteins. One scientist
has likened these units to letters of the alphabet, which,
being combined, spell many proteins. When a protein contains
all of the essential units, it may be said to be &ldquo;complete,&rdquo;
the best example of which may be seen in milk, eggs,
and meat. When a protein lacks some of the essential
elements, or letters of the protein alphabet, it is said to be
incomplete. Gelatin is the best example of this type of
protein, but the cereals and beans must likewise be supplemented
by other substances; milk being the one most
generally used for this purpose. For the purpose of building
young tissues, and maintaining those already mature, it is
logical to use foods containing the foodstuffs in their best
form; that is, those that not only contain the complete
protein, but also the requisite mineral salts and vitamines.
Foods lacking in some of these respects become adequate
when supplemented by these foods which can supply the
missing constituents; hence, the use of such incomplete
protein foods need not necessarily be abandoned, for, as in
the case of cereals, the foods are both economical and palatable,
and, when used in addition to milk, furnish valuable
adjuncts to the dietary.</p>

<p><strong>Classification of Proteins.</strong>&mdash;A brief description of some
of the more important proteins with which we are chiefly
concerned will serve to simplify the formulation of a diet.
Those assuming the most important position in nutrition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
and food are <strong>globulins</strong>, <strong>albumens</strong>, <strong>nucleoproteins</strong>, <strong>phosphoproteins</strong>,
<strong>hemoglobins</strong>, and <strong>derived proteins</strong> such as
proteoses and peptones. The albumens and globulins associated
together occur in the tissues of both animals and
plants. The albumens are richer in sulphur than the
globulins and are found more abundantly in the animal
fluids, such as the blood, while the globulins predominate
in the more solid tissues of animals and in plants. The
close association of these two proteins is particularly noticeable
in the blood and cells. They have different characteristics, however.</p>

<p><strong>Albumins.</strong>&mdash;The best examples are found in egg albumin
(white of egg), lactalbumin (milk), serum albumin
(blood), leucosin (wheat), legumelin (peas). Albumins are
all soluble in pure water, and are coagulable by heat. Coagulation,
due to the action of the ferments in the body,
takes place in milk, blood, and muscle plasma. Certain
albumens are particularly adapted for the building and repairing
of tissues. Among those that have been used in
feeding experiments to determine whether or not they were
capable, when used as the sole protein in the diet, of maintaining
animals in normal nutrition, and of supporting normal
growth in the young animal,&mdash;may be cited lactalbumin
and egg albumin. These experiments provided diets
adequate in other respects, the object being to determine
the value of the various proteins. It was found that the
albumin from milk was more efficient in this respect than
the egg albumin.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In the invalid dietary the solubility of the albumins in
water makes them of especial value as reinforcing agents,
since they may be introduced into fluids without materially
altering either their flavor or their bulk.</p>

<p><strong>Globulins.</strong>&mdash;Simple proteins, insoluble in pure water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
but soluble in neutral salt solutions; examples, muscle
globulin, serum globulin (blood), edestin (wheat), physelin
(beans), legumin (beans and peas), tuberin (potatoes),
amandin (almonds), arachin, and conarachin (peanuts).</p>

<p><strong>Alcohol-Soluble Proteins.</strong>&mdash;Simple proteins soluble in
alcohol of from 70-80% strength. Insoluble in absolute
alcohol, water and other neutral solvents. Examples of
these proteins may be seen in the gliadin of wheat, zein of
corn, and hordein of barley.</p>

<p><strong>Albuminoids.</strong>&mdash;These substances represent one group
of incomplete proteins, inasmuch as they cannot alone support
protein metabolism. However, they are classed with
the proteins and may be substituted for at least a part of
these compounds in the daily dietary, since they are able
to do much of the work of the pure proteins. The best
example of this group is seen in gelatin. This substance
contains many of the structural units of meat protein
but in very different relative amounts. It has not, therefore,
the chemical units necessary to repair the worn-out
parts of cell machinery.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><strong>Conjugated Proteins:&mdash;Nucleoproteins, Phosphoproteins
and Hemoglobin.</strong></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <strong>Nucleoproteins.</strong>&mdash;This type
of protein is characteristic of all cell nuclei, and is particularly
abundant in the highly nucleated secreting cells of the
glandular organs, such as the liver, pancreas, and the thymus
gland. The nucleoproteins are composed of simple proteins
and nuclein. Nucleic acid is rich in phosphorus and
upon decomposition yields some of the purin bases (xanthin,
adenin, guanin), a carbohydrate and phosphoric acid.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <strong>Phosphoproteins.</strong>&mdash;Compounds in which the phosphorus
is in organic union with the protein molecule otherwise
than a nucleic acid or lecithin. Examples: caseinogin
(milk), ovovitellin (egg yolk).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
(<i>c</i>) <strong>Hemoglobin.</strong>&mdash;Much of the greater part of the iron
existing in the body occurs as a constituent of the hemoglobin
of the red blood cells. When the intake of iron is
not sufficient to cover the output, there must be a consequent
diminution in the hemoglobin of the blood with a
corresponding development of anemia.</p>

<p>The importance of knowing these characteristic proteins
is apparent. Not only will such knowledge lead to a more
intelligent use of protein foods in the normal dietary, but
it will prove of the greatest assistance in the adjusting of
the foodstuffs in diet for individuals suffering from certain
abnormal conditions.</p>

<p>In abnormal conditions this knowledge of the various
proteins&mdash;their composition, source, and behavior in the
body assumes a position of the greatest importance; since
it represents the means for safeguarding a patient from the
results caused by the wrong kind of food. In certain types
of nephritis, for example, it is perfectly safe to give milk
where the ingestion of meat and eggs might cause serious,
if not fatal, results. In treating gout, when it is deemed
advisable to limit the purin foods in order to control in a
measure the retention of uric acid in the body, the realization
that certain of the nucleoproteins, upon being
broken down in the body, yield the purins, which in
turn give rise to the production of uric acid, will permit
the nurse to adjust the diet so as to eliminate such foods
entirely (see <a href="#chap22">Gout</a>). The importance of keeping the
hemoglobin content of the blood normal has already been
mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>The Effect of Heat upon Proteins.</strong>&mdash;The fact that certain
proteins are most susceptible to heat has already been
stated, but the application of this knowledge in the preparation
of protein foods is important. In milk, for example,
whole raw milk forms a large hard curd; whereas boiled
milk curdles in a much finer and softer form. Pasteurized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
milk shows smaller curds than raw whole milk, but larger
than the boiled whole milk.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>An egg cooked by the application of a long-continued
high temperature (212&deg; F.) has a tough white; whereas an
egg cooked until hard at a temperature under the boiling
point shows a tenderness in the white which renders it
distinctly more palatable. Soft-cooked eggs leave the
stomach in less time than is required for hard cooked ones;
poached (cooked in water under the boiling point), shirred
eggs (cooked in hot dish), and soft-cooked eggs are among
the most readily digestible forms of eggs. Raw eggs are
slightly less stimulating to acid secretion in the stomach and
require a longer time to leave the stomach than boiled eggs.
Thus it is seen that in many cases the difference in preparation
of the protein foods may make a difference in the way
in which the digestive tract handles them. Necessarily, this
point is emphasized more in abnormal than in normal conditions;
for example, albuminized orange juice gives rise to
a distinct gastric secretion, and leaves the stomach rapidly&mdash;a
great advantage in certain abnormal conditions, and
especially in those requiring liquid diet of high nutriment
value.</p>

<p>The knowledge of the coagulation of proteins by heat
points out the advantage of using cold water over hot in
the preliminary cleansing of utensils in which protein foods
have been prepared. Certain members of this group are
soluble in pure water, and will readily dissolve; whereas,
if the water is heated, their coagulation would prevent
this taking place so readily.</p>

<p><strong>Functions of Protein in the Body.</strong>&mdash;The proteins serve
two distinct uses in the body; first, that of building and
repairing tissues and furnishing, in conjunction with other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
substances, material for growth; second, that of producing
energy for the internal and external work of the body. For
this latter function a large percentage of the proteins ingested
is used; consequently, since the carbohydrates and
fats are primarily the energy furnishing material most
readily used by the organism, it is clearly demonstrated that
the average individual takes more protein into the body
than is necessary for its maintenance. Except during the
period when an allowance for growth must be made, it
is probable that a much smaller daily consumption of protein
could be made without disadvantage to the organism,
leaving the bulk of the work, in so far as the running of the
engine is concerned, to the other organic foodstuffs.</p>


<h3>WATER</h3>

<p>Man can exist for days, even weeks, without food, but
without water life soon becomes extinct. This substance is
composed of hydrogen and oxygen in the proportion of two
to one; that is, to each atom of oxygen there will be found
two atoms of hydrogen. This is always the case no matter
where it is found. When foods are put through a drying
process the water is taken out and the rest of the chemical
composition of the food remains unchanged.</p>

<p>This foodstuff, unlike those belonging to the organic
group, is not changed during the process of digestion, nor
does the application of heat or cold affect it, save from a
physical standpoint. Water boils at a temperature of
100&deg; C. (212&deg; F.), and freezes at a temperature of 0&deg; C.
(32&deg; F.).</p>

<p><strong>Function of Water.</strong>&mdash;The uses of water in the body
are many, and the advantage arising from a sufficient
amount of this foodstuff in the dietary cannot be overestimated.
It is no longer considered an error in diet to drink
a moderate amount of water with the meals, so long as it
is not used as a substitute for mastication, and as a means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
of washing the food into the stomach. In the diet, both
as a beverage and as a part of most of the food materials
ingested, water serves to moisten the tissues; to furnish the
fluid medium for all of the secretions and excretions of the
body; to carry food materials in solution to all parts of the
organism; to stimulate secretory cells producing the digestive
juices, thereby aiding in the processes of digestion,
absorption and excretion; to promote circulation; to furnish
material for free diuresis, thus preventing to a great extent
the retention of injurious substances by the body, which
might otherwise take place.</p>

<p><strong>Factors Determining the Amount of Water Needed.</strong>&mdash;In
normal conditions it is probable that the kind and
amount of exercise taken has more to do with the amount
of water needed by the body than any other factor, since
the vigorously worked body excretes more water by way of
the skin than the quiescent one. With a normal amount of
exercise, it is advisable to drink from six to eight glasses
of water each day, increasing the amount to a certain extent
when exercise causes a great loss through perspiration. It
is always advisable, however, to keep in mind that an excessive
amount of fluid taken into the body throws a corresponding
amount of work on the organs (the stomach, kidneys
and heart). In certain abnormal conditions, the
body&rsquo;s water supply is depleted. This is particularly true
in the case of hemorrhage, vomiting, and diarrhea. Under
other conditions (certain types of nephritis), the body becomes
overburdened through the excess of water retained,
owing to the difficulty which the kidneys show in eliminating
it. This retention of water by the tissues gives rise to
the condition known as edema.</p>


<h3>MINERAL SALTS</h3>

<p><strong>Ash.</strong>&mdash;The eight remaining chemical elements, <i>i.e.</i>,
calcium, magnesium, sulphur, iron, sodium, potassium,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
phosphorus, chlorine, constituting the mineral salts or ash,
are likewise classed as food on account of the work which
they perform in the body. Some of these elements enter
the body as essential constituents of the organic compounds,
and are metabolized in the body as such, becoming inorganic
only upon oxidation of the organic materials of which
they form a part.</p>

<p><strong>Importance of the Mineral Salts.</strong>&mdash;The way in which
the mineral elements exist in the body and take part in
its functions, has been graphically outlined by Sherman as
follows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;(1) As bone constituents, giving rigidity and relative
permanence to the skeletal tissues. (2) As essential elements
of the organic compounds which are the chief solids
of the soft tissues (muscles, blood cells, etc.). (3) As soluble
salts (electrolytes) held in solution in the fluids of the
body; giving to those fluids their characteristic influence
upon the elasticity and irritability of muscle and nerve;
supplying material for the acidity and alkalinity of the digestive
juices and other secretions; and yet maintaining
the neutrality, or slight alkalescence, of the internal fluids
as well as their osmotic pressure and solvent power.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The above outline, showing the various ways in which
the mineral constituents enter and take part in the various
functions, as well as in the structure of the body, make it
evident that the same close attention and study which was
given to the other foodstuffs must be accorded to these substances.
When the student realizes that the presence of
certain salts dissolved in the blood assists in the regulation
of the vital processes of the body such as the digestion,
circulation and respiration; that they are responsible for
the contraction and relaxation of the muscles; that they assist
in controlling the nerves; that they are, in a way,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
instrumental in releasing the energy locked up in food&mdash;the
value of these elements becomes very evident, and their
importance in the dietary inestimable. Some of the mineral
salts are more widely distributed in food than others, and
the danger arising from their deficiency in the diet is not
so great as is the case with others; hence attention is called
to those found by investigators to be most often lacking or
deficient in the average diet; <i>i.e.</i>, calcium, phosphorus, and
iron. A brief summary of the special parts played by these
elements will be outlined here.</p>

<p><strong>Calcium.</strong>&mdash;Physiology teaches that about eighty-five
per cent. of the mineral matter of the bone, or at least three-quarters
of the ash of the entire body, consists of calcium
phosphates. It has long been known that this mineral salt
is necessary for the coagulation of the blood, and science
has demonstrated that &ldquo;the alternate contractions and relaxations
which constitute the normal beating of the heart
are dependent, at least in part, upon the presence of a sufficient,
but not excessive concentration of calcium salts in
the fluid which bathes the heart muscles.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><strong>Phosphorus.</strong>&mdash;According to Sherman, phosphorus
compounds are as widely distributed in the body, and as
strictly essential to every living cell as are proteins. Science
has also proved that they are important constituents in the
skeleton, in milk, in glandular tissue, in sexual elements, and
in the nervous system; that these compounds take part
in the functions of cell multiplication, in the activation and
control of enzyme actions, in the maintenance of neutrality
in the body; that they exert an influence on the osmotic
pressure and surface tension of the body, and upon the processes
of absorption and secretion. Like calcium, phosphorus
is absolutely essential to the growth and development
of the body, and, as in the case of the mineral, its
presence in the dietary must be accorded strict attention, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
order to avoid the results accruing from its deficiency.
Casein, or caseinogen of milk and egg yolk (ovovitellin), are
the substances richest in this mineral salt. The fact that
the phosphorus existing in grains (cereals) may be removed
largely in the process of milling, makes it advisable to
consider the use of the breads made from the whole grains.</p>

<p><strong>Iron.</strong>&mdash;The presence of iron as an essential constituent
of hemoglobin has already been discussed. That which
is not in the hemoglobin is chiefly found in the chromatin
substances of the cells.</p>

<p>The body does not keep a reserve store of iron on hand
as is the case with calcium and phosphorus in the bone
tissues, but must depend upon the daily intake in food to
supply its needs. The iron content of food materials is
not large, but a careful regulation of the iron bearing foods
(see Table on page <a href="#Page_5">5</a>) will make it easy to cover the demands
of the body with a material which has been found
to do its work most efficiently. Medicinal iron has received
much attention in the determination of the essential needs
of the body. &ldquo;Whether medicinal iron actually serves as
material for the construction of hemoglobin is not positively
known, but we have what appears to be a good evidence
that food iron is assimilated and used for growth and for
regeneration of the hemoglobin to much better advantage
than are inorganic or synthetic forms, and that when medicinal
iron increases the production of hemoglobin, its
effect is more beneficial in proportion as food iron is more
abundant&mdash;a strong indication that the medicinal iron acts
by stimulation rather than as material for the construction
of hemoglobin&rdquo; (Sherman).</p>

<p>The newborn infant has a store of iron already on hand,
derived from the mother through the placenta before birth.
After the birth, and through the nursing period, the child
receives a certain amount of iron from the mother&rsquo;s milk.
This supply is not altogether reliable, however, since any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
disturbance of the digestion will tend to interfere with its
absorption, and consequently deprive the organism of what
would otherwise be used for the building up of the blood
supply. Thus it is clearly indicated that the infant&rsquo;s safest
source of iron is from the mother during the pre-natal
period. This supply must necessarily come from her diet
during this time, and is made possible by regulating day
by day the iron bearing foods in her dietary. After the
original store of iron is reduced to that of the adult (after
the child has tripled in birth-weight, generally at 12 or 13
months), and during the remainder of the growth period,
it is very necessary to regulate the iron-bearing food in
the diet, in order to insure the child of an adequate amount
to cover the demands made by the increasing blood supply.</p>


<h3>VITAMINES</h3>

<p>Up to a few years ago it was believed a complete diet
should contain an adequate amount of protein of a proper
type, a sufficient amount of calcium, phosphorus and iron,
and enough carbohydrates and fats to furnish the body with
sufficient fuel to cover its energy expenditures. This belief
was proved to be incorrect a number of years ago by Dr.
Hopkins of England. In making certain feeding experiments
with rats, Dr. Hopkins showed that some substance
or substances present in milk, other than those already
mentioned, was essential for the growth of the animal;
that animals deprived of this material grew for a time, but
gradually ceased to do so. Later on, Osborne, Mendel,
McCollum and Davis discovered a like substance in butter
fat; and still later Dr. McCollum found the same growth
stimulating material, or one very like it, existing in the
leaves of plants. These scientists found, upon investigation,
that there were probably two substances in milk&mdash;one
soluble in the fat, the other in the protein-free and fat-free
whey&mdash;both of which were essential for normal growth. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
1911 Dr. Funk discovered in rice polishings a substance
which he believed to be a cure and preventive of Beri-beri;
to this substance, which is now believed to be identical
with the second substance found in milk, he gave the
name &ldquo;vitamine.&rdquo; Dr. Funk&rsquo;s name &ldquo;Vitamine&rdquo; is now accepted
to cover a number of substances essential to growth,
and for the prevention and cure of certain diseases. To
the first two has been added a third member of the vitamine
family, which has proved to be a cure and preventive of
scurvy. These substances are called&mdash;on account of the
substances in which they are soluble&mdash;&ldquo;Fat soluble A,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Water soluble B,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Water soluble C.&rdquo; The table on
page <a href="#table5">496</a> shows the sources from which these factors may
be obtained. The four plus system is used by Dr. Eddy to
describe the abundance with which they occur.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><strong>Function of &ldquo;Fat Soluble A.&rdquo;</strong>&mdash;All investigators agree
that the &ldquo;A&rdquo; vitamine is an essential factor in the growth of
young tissue, and the repair of mature tissues. McCollum
claims that this vitamine is likewise a factor in the prevention
of the eye disease known as xerophthalmia, and
other scientists also hold this opinion. Eddy states that a
diet lacking in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; vitamine will, in the majority of
cases, result in stunted growth and the development of the
eye disease, and that the appearance of the latter may be
taken as a sure indication of the absence or deficiency of
this vitamine.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the effect of adding fat
soluble &ldquo;A&rdquo; to the diet which was adequate in other respects.
This chart represents the growth curve of young
rats.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Figure showing the effect upon growth of adding &ldquo;fat soluble A&rdquo;<br />
to a diet adequate in all other respects.<br />

<p>Mellanby of England believes the &ldquo;A&rdquo; vitamine to be
a factor in the prevention of rickets. Scientists of America
have recently investigated this disease, and Dr. Hess (New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
York) has found cod liver oil to be a remedy for it. Cod
liver oil is known to be rich in &ldquo;Fat soluble A,&rdquo; but whether
the cure of rickets is due to the presence of this vitamine in
the oil, or to a possible fourth vitamine, is still undetermined.</p>

<p><strong>Effect of Heat on the &ldquo;A&rdquo; Vitamine.</strong>&mdash;Heat, as applied
in the ordinary methods of cooking, is not believed to
exert a great deal of destruction upon the &ldquo;A&rdquo; type of
vitamine; but hydrogenation, the process
used in the hardening of certain
fats in the manufacture of lard substitutes,
is said to destroy it completely.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Water Soluble B.&rdquo;</strong>&mdash;The second
vitamine discovered in milk and believed
to be identical with the Funk
vitamine is more widely distributed
than the &ldquo;A&rdquo; vitamine. For this reason
it is not so likely to be deficient in the
diet as is found to be the case with the
&ldquo;A.&rdquo; A glance at the table shows that
the best sources outside of yeast are the
seeds of plants and the milk and eggs
of animals. In beans and peas the &ldquo;B&rdquo;
vitamine is distributed throughout the
entire seed, but in the cereal grains
it is found chiefly in the embryo. As a result, bread made
from fine white flour or meal is much more apt to be deficient
in vitamine of the &ldquo;B&rdquo; type than that which is made
from the whole grain; the same is true of rice and other
cereals. Spinach, potatoes, carrots and turnips show an
appreciable amount of the vitamine, but beets are known
to be extremely poor in it. Nuts too are considered a
valuable source.</p>

<p><strong>Function of the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Vitamine.</strong>&mdash;Like the &ldquo;A&rdquo; vitamine,
water soluble &ldquo;B&rdquo; is believed to be essential to growth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
Funk established its value as a preventive and cure of Beri-beri,
the disease common in the Orient among people living
largely upon a diet of polished rice and fish. Besides being
a growth-stimulating substance and an antineuritic, the
&ldquo;B&rdquo; vitamine is highly valued for its stimulating effect upon
the appetite. To this property is probably due at least
part of the credit for which certain substances work for
the promotion of growth in animals. This can be utilized
to good advantage for children showing a disposition to refuse
food, by supplementing formulas made from milk,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
with the expressed juice of vegetables and fruits known to
be rich in the &ldquo;B&rdquo; vitamine.</p>

<p><strong>Effect of Heat on the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Vitamine.</strong>&mdash;This vitamine
also shows a resistance to heat; that is, as applied in the
methods generally used in cooking, pasteurization temperatures
do not materially affect the vitamine property of the
formula as far as the &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; factors are concerned.</p>

<p><strong>The Effect of Alkali (Soda) upon the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Vitamine.</strong>&mdash;It
has been an ordinary practice to add soda to the
water in which certain vegetables are cooked, for the ostensible
purpose of softening the vegetables and hastening their
cooking. The practice has been condemned by many scientists
who are making experiments along these lines, on
account of its destructive power upon the &ldquo;B&rdquo; vitamine.
Chick and Hume in England claim that when the amount
of food given contains originally just sufficient vitamines
to cover the growth factor the use of soda in the cooking
water does serious harm to these vitamines. This is a
point well worth remembering. It is often difficult to persuade
certain individuals to eat vegetables in appreciable
quantities; if the vitamines were reduced though the
method of preparing the food, these individuals would not
obtain a sufficient quantity of the vitamines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
<strong>&ldquo;Water Soluble C.&rdquo;</strong>&mdash;The third member of the vitamine
family is known for its antiscorbutic property; that
is, it is the best known cure and preventive of scurvy.
It likewise exerts a certain amount of influence upon the
growth of the animal and must be present in the diet, in
order that the health and well-being of the individual may
be safeguarded. The &ldquo;C&rdquo; vitamine, like the &ldquo;B&rdquo; vitamine,
is soluble in water, and is present to an appreciable extent
in the fresh juices of the fruits and vegetables. Some are
richer in this respect than others (orange and tomato juice),
while the cereals, grains, seed of plants, sugars, oils, and
meats are singularly deficient. Milk (whole) does not contain
a great amount of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; vitamine, and this amount
is still further reduced under certain methods of preparation.
Milk powders, made either from the whole or the skimmed
milk, are found to contain only very small amounts of this
essential substance. Condensed milk and cream are supposed
to be free of &ldquo;C,&rdquo; and the same is true of eggs.</p>

<p><strong>Effect of Heat on &ldquo;C&rdquo; Vitamine.</strong>&mdash;All authorities
agree that the &ldquo;C&rdquo; vitamine is much more sensitive to heat
than the other two; and for this reason much of the value
obtained from this vitamine in uncooked material may be
lost when the food containing it is subjected to long-continued
heat. Hess claims that the temperature used for
pasteurizing milk for some time, is more destructive to this
vitamine than boiling water temperature continued for a
few minutes only.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> There is need for care in formulating
the diet for children to see that they are given fresh fruit
every day; or when that is not possible, to see that they are
at least given tomato juice. This substance is rich in the
antiscorbutic vitamine, and according to experiments made
by Sherman, LeMer and Campbell, loses fifty per cent. of
its antiscorbutic power when boiled one hour. Dr. Delf at
the Lister Institute experimented with raw and cooked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
cabbage, and found that when this material was cooked for
one hour at temperatures ranging from 80&deg; to 90&deg; C the
loss in antiscorbutic power amounted to 90% in the
cooked leaves over the raw material. Dr. Delf also concluded
from her experiments that it was advisable to add
neither acid nor alkali in the cooking of vegetables if these
substances were to give their maximum value of vitamines.</p>

<p>From the foregoing description of these vitamine factors,
it is readily seen why so many dietaries are deficient
in these essential substances. The limited sources from
which to obtain the &ldquo;A&rdquo; vitamine; the sensitiveness of the
&ldquo;B&rdquo; vitamine to the action of alkalies; the sensitiveness
of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; vitamine to heat, alkali and acid, moreover the
limitation of its presence chiefly to the fresh fruits and
plant juices,&mdash;all point to the need of special care in the
selection of the food materials and of the manner in which
these materials are prepared for consumption.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p>In the descriptions just given of the various foodstuffs,
especially in regard to their function in the body, it is readily
seen that no one foodstuff is used to the exclusion of
another. It is further seen that in the upkeep of the body,
which includes not only the building and repairing of its tissues,
but the running of the engine and maintaining of its
normal temperature, the organism uses each and all of
the organic food substances for the production of heat.
Furthermore, while the tissues are chiefly built from protein
material, and physiology teaches that protein can be built
only from other protein, these tissues contain a certain
amount of carbohydrate, fat, mineral salts, and water; this
furnishes distinct evidence that the building of the cells
and tissues of the body cannot be accomplished by means
of protein alone, but by the judicious balancing of all the
foodstuffs in the dietary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
Science has gone even further than this, as has just
been demonstrated, and has proven that without the substances
known as vitamines the normal growth and development
in the young would be arrested, and that the maintenance
of the adult body would be impaired. It has also
proven that certain diseases owe their development to deficiencies
in the vitamine supply to the body.</p>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02"></a>CHAPTER II<br />
<br />
THE FUEL VALUE OF FOOD</h2>


<p>Science has proved that the human body is composed
of certain chemical elements and that food materials are
combinations of like elements; it has likewise proved that
the body will utilize her own structure for fuel to carry
on the work of her various functions unless material is
supplied for this purpose from an outside source, namely,
food, which in chemical composition so closely resembles
that of the human body.</p>

<p><strong>Amount and Type of Food.</strong>&mdash;The next point of investigation
would logically be the amount and kind of
food necessary to best accomplish this purpose. To be able
to do this it was necessary to have some standard unit by
which to measure the amount of heat each food was capable
of producing when burned outside the body, after
which it was more or less simple to calculate the heat production
of each of the food combinations within the organism.
An apparatus known as the &ldquo;Bomb Calorimeter&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
was devised by Berthelot, and adapted for the examination
of food materials by Atwater and Blakesley. The food material
to be tested was placed within the bomb, which was
charged with a known amount of pure oxygen. The bomb
was then sealed and immersed in a weighed amount of pure
water, into which a very delicate thermometer was inserted.
The food within the bomb was ignited by means of an
electric fuse, and the heat given off by the burning of the
material was communicated to the surrounding water and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
was registered upon the thermometer. It was evident that
some definite name had to be devised by which these heat
units might be known. Hence the name &ldquo;<strong>calorie</strong>,&rdquo; which
represents <em>the amount of heat required to raise the temperature
of 1 kilogram of pure water 1 degree centigrade, or
about 4 pounds of water 1 degree Fahrenheit</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Transformation of Foods into Available Fuel.</strong>&mdash;A
comparison has been made between the human body and
steam engine, but this comparison is not adequate, since
the food does not produce heat within the body originally,
but energy of which heat is a by-product. Each food combination
has a certain amount of dormant energy within its
structure and this energy does not become active nor can
it be utilized by the body until the food, of which it is a
part, is changed within the organism to substances more
nearly like its own. This liberated active energy is then
used as a motive power to carry on the internal and external
work of the body, and the heat, which is invariably
the consequence of any active energy (motion), leaves the
body as such. It will be seen, then, that the human body
acts not as a steam engine, but rather as a <strong>transforming
machine</strong> by means of which the dormant energy of the food
is transformed into an active agent of which heat is a natural
result.</p>

<p>In the calorimeter it was found that the carbohydrates
and fats burned to the same end products, namely, carbon
dioxide and water, while the proteins, upon oxidation, produced
carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen gas. In the body
it was found that the carbohydrates and the fats acted in
exactly the same manner as in the calorimeter, producing
the same end products. But this was not the case with the
proteins; the oxidation process of this chemical combination
was found to be not nearly so complete within the body
as in the calorimeter, and instead of the free nitrogen as
produced in the apparatus there were urea and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
nitrogenous substances eliminated which, while combustible,
represented a less complete oxidation of the proteins.</p>

<p>The following table represents the amount of heat produced
as the result of a complete oxidation of the foodstuffs
in the calorimeter.</p>

<p>The loss of potential energy due to the incomplete oxidation
of the proteins in the body is approximately 1.3 calories
to each gram of protein in food; consequently in calculating
the fuel value of protein foods, due allowance must be
made for these losses. Allowance must also be made for
the incomplete digestion, or losses occurring in the digestion,
of the foodstuffs. These losses, as well as the approximate
amount of each constituent absorbed, are represented
in the following table.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<h3>EFFECT OF HEAT AND COLD UPON THE FOODSTUFFS</h3>

<p>In primeval days, when man led a more natural life, his
very existence depended upon his ability to wrest from the
earth his 4&mdash;9&mdash;4; these, then, constitute what are
known as the &ldquo;physiological fuel factors&rdquo; of carbohydrates,
fats, and proteins respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Determination of Fuel Value of Food.</strong>&mdash;In determining
the amount of heat produced by a given amount of
food, it is first essential to reduce the amount to grams
(for example, 1 lb. equals 480 grams): first, because the
gram is a unit of weight commonly used in dietetic calculations;
second, because the fuel factors are based on the
amount of heat produced by the burning of one gram of
organic foodstuffs. Knowing the composition of food, that
is the number of hundredths of protein, carbohydrate and
fat it contains, it is a simple matter to estimate its fuel
value by multiplying the amount of each contained in one
gram by its physiological fuel factor 4.4.9. Thus if the
composition of a food is 3-3/10% protein, 4% fat and 5%
carbohydrate, one gram would contain .033 gram of protein,
.04 gram of fat and 0.5 gram of carbohydrate. Hence
one gram of milk would produce</p>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Estimation of fuel value from 1 gram of milk">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">.033 &times; 4</td>
    <td class="tdc">=</td>
    <td class="tdl">.132 calorie from protein</td>
  </tr>

    <td class="tdr">.04<span class="hide">0</span> &times; 9</td>
    <td class="tdc">=</td>
    <td class="tdl">.36<span class="hide">0</span> calorie from fat</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">.05<span class="hide">0</span> &times; 4</td>
    <td class="tdc">=</td>
    <td class="tdl">.20<span class="hide">0</span> calorie from carbohydrate</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">&nbsp;</td>
    <td class="tdc">or</td>
    <td class="tdl">.692 calorie in all</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>But it is not necessary to estimate the fuel value of so small
a quantity as one gram, and, since the value of protein,
carbohydrates and fats is always the same it is more satisfactory
to estimate the amount of the organic constituents
contained in the entire given quantity of food, rather than
stopping to figure out the fuel value of the small quantity.</p>

<p>This is done by multiplying the entire number of grams
of food given by the amount of protein, fat and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
carbohydrate contained in one gram, then multiplying these results
by the physiological fuel factor of each. Thus 100
grams of milk would yield</p>

    <td class="tdl">69.2 calories from 100 grams of milk.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p><strong>The Standard or 100 Calorie Portion.</strong>&mdash;Just as it has
been more convenient to estimate a larger rather than a
smaller quantity of food material, so it is frequently more desirable
to estimate a hundred calories, rather than one
calorie. This is especially useful when dietaries of high
caloric (fuel) value are to be estimated, or dietaries in
which foods of like composition and fuel value are to be
interchangeable. In such cases it is a simple matter to
select the desired number of 100 calorie portions of those
foods which are to make up the dietary.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><strong>Method of Estimating the 100 Calorie Portion.</strong>&mdash;The
number of calories yielded by 100 grams of food material is
taken as a basis upon which to estimate the 100 calorie
portion, and X represents the number of grams required to
yield this portion. The problem is one of &ldquo;simple proportion,&rdquo;
for example, take the 100 grams of milk just estimated,
we found that 100 grams (or c.c.) furnished 69.2
calories of heat, then, 100:69.2&nbsp;::&nbsp;X:100&mdash;145; or 145
grams of milk are required to furnish 100 calories of heat.
Suppose it is desirable to substitute eggs for a part of the
milk in the diet, eggs have a higher fuel value per unit of
weight than milk, their average composition being 13.4%
protein, and 10.5% fat (no appreciable amount of carbohydrates),
100 grams of eggs would yield</p>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Estimation of fuel value from 100 grams of eggs">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">100 &times; .134</td>
    <td class="tdc">=</td>
    <td class="tdc">13.4 &times; 4</td>
    <td class="tdc">=</td>
    <td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;53.6 calories from protein</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">100 &times; .105</td>
    <td class="tdc">=</td>
    <td class="tdc">10.5 &times; 9</td>
    <td class="tdc">=</td>
    <td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;94.5 calories from fat,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr" colspan="4">or a total of</td>
    <td class="tdl">148 calories.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
The Standard or 100 calorie portion of eggs would be,</p>

<p class="center">100:148&nbsp;::&nbsp;X:100&nbsp;=&nbsp;68</p>

<p>or the number of grams required to yield 100 calories.</p>

<p>Thus it is seen that in using the fuel value of a hundred
grams of food material for estimating the standard or 100
calories portion the extremes are always the same.
Hence, the weight of the 100 calorie portion may always
be obtained by multiplying the extremes and dividing the
result by the number of calories furnished by 100 grams of
food material.</p>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a>CHAPTER III<br />
<br />
THE FOOD REQUIREMENTS OF THE BODY</h2>


<p>The human body, as far as can be judged, does not use
one nutrient to the exclusion of another, but science has
proved that the best results are obtained from diets balanced
to suit the needs of the body, providing the fuel and
repair materials in the amounts which are calculated to
give the maximum value with the minimum expenditure
on the part of the organism.</p>

<p>For while no two individuals are exactly alike, there are
factors which govern or influence the food requirements of
all, and thus make it possible to estimate the needs of the
body with a fair degree of accuracy.</p>

<p>It has been found, by means of calorimeter experiments
(direct and indirect), that a certain amount of heat is produced
within the body, regardless of external movement or
food; that is, when a body is lying absolutely quiet with no
movement save that of breathing, the internal work of the
organism, which is continuous, releases so much heat, and
this is produced whether there is food to replace it or
whether the body structure is burned. This is known as
the <strong>basal rate of metabolism</strong>, and constitutes the normal
<strong>basal requirements</strong>. Any external movement will increase
this rate; the greater the activity the higher the increase.
Consequently external work calls for food in addition to
that which is used to run the engine, in order to save the
body from destruction.</p>

<p>DuBois<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> finds &ldquo;Basal Metabolism above normal in
exophthalmic goiter, in fevers, in lymphatic leukemia, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
in pernicious anemia, in severe cardiac disease, and in
some cases of severe diabetes and cancer; it is lower than
normal in cretinism, and in myxedema, in old age, in some
wasting diseases and perhaps in some cases of obesity.&rdquo;
This fluctuation in the Basal Rate of metabolism furnishes
a factor in the diagnosis of disease, not only recognized but
coming more and more in use.</p>


<h3>FACTORS DETERMINING THE FOOD REQUIREMENTS
OF THE BODY</h3>

<p><strong>For the Adult.</strong>&mdash;Muscular activity, Age and Size, are
most important factors influencing the food requirements.
The physical condition and environment of the individual
also exert a certain amount of influence upon the intake of
food.</p>

<p><strong>Work.</strong>&mdash;Muscular activity, as already stated, increases
the body expenditures; consequently the more active the
work the greater amount of energy food needed per unit of
weight.</p>

<p><strong>Age.</strong>&mdash;As the individual grows older, the rate of metabolism
decreases until, in old age, it is not more than
a third to a fifth of what it was in earlier life. This is due
to a general &ldquo;slowing down&rdquo; of the machinery, the heart
does not beat so rapidly, nor is the respiration so quick.
The digestive organs, the heart, the liver, and the kidneys,
cannot handle the volume of food which was required during
the period of greatest physical activity. Hence, any
great excess over and above that which is needed for the
maintenance of the body in health will be a source of
danger to the elderly person. Von Noorden claims the
food requirements of individuals from</p>

<div class="ctext">
<p>60 to 70 years of age to be reduced 10%; for people from<br />
70 to 80 years of age to be reduced 20%; for people from<br />
80 to 90 years of age to be reduced 30%.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
<strong>Sex.</strong>&mdash;Science has proved, that there is little difference
in the food requirements of men and women, provided they
are alike in age, weight and size, and are doing the same
amount and type of work. But women, as a rule, weigh
less than men, hence their food requirements are approximately
less.</p>

<p>Murlin finds the food requirements of pregnant women
to be some what higher than of non-pregnant ones, and
the requirements of the nursing mother to be higher than
either (see chapter on <a href="#chap08">Pregnancy and Lactation</a>).</p>

<p><strong>For the Child.</strong>&mdash;The factors influencing the food requirements
are different, to a certain extent, from those of
the adult. The main difference lies in the fact that the
adult needs food only for the maintenance and repair of
the body, while the child must have food, not only to cover
its maintenance requirements, but to support the growth
and development which should be continuous from birth
to maturity. Resistance, too, must be developed during
this period in order to safeguard the child through life.</p>

<p>The rate of metabolism in the infant is greater than at
any other period of life, consequently, even if a child were
one-third the weight of its parent, it would inevitably cease
to grow and would become malnourished, if its food requirements
were reckoned at only one-third that of the
parent.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusting the Food Requirements.</strong>&mdash;Taking these factors
as guides for estimating the food requirements of man,
it is evident that no hard and fast law can be laid down to
cover all, that each individual must adjust the food intake
according to the weight and activity of the body. Sherman
has arranged the following table showing the energy expenditures
per hour for the average man (154 pounds), per
pound of body weight (these are approximate averages
only).</p>

<p>The above table, calculated for an average man weighing
154 pounds, may seem less simple to use than one
based on the energy requirements per pound of body weight
per hour, of an average individual. For example, a man
weighing 123 pounds and performing practically the same
amount and type of work as done by the man weighing
154 pounds would require practically one-fifth less calories
than the latter individual. Hence, to facilitate the estimation
of the food requirements for average individuals, the
following table is included.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Possibly a few explanatory words, as to the terms used
in the above tables, will assist the nurse in making the necessary
calculation. &ldquo;Sleeping quietly&rdquo; makes allowance
for no movement save that of respiration; any undue restlessness
will call for an increase in the above allowance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
&ldquo;Sitting at rest&rdquo; includes the time spent at meals, sitting
in class room, ward office, studying or reading. It does
not include much walking about the room, rising frequently,
or nervous restlessness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light exercise&rdquo; includes all light house work, running
an ordinary sewing machine, walking about office or ward,
(receiving ward included). It does not include washing,
sweeping or scrubbing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Active exercise&rdquo; includes washing, sweeping, scrubbing,
general house work, carpentry, and such sports as
tennis, basket ball, and ordinary gymnasium work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Severe exercise&rdquo; includes road workers (working with
pick and shovel) fast running, baseball, football, and
swimming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very severe exercise&rdquo; includes the work done by
miners, handling of freight, and lumbermen, especially
those working in extreme cold, where the severe cold makes
extra demands on the fuel supply. By making use of the
averages just mentioned it should be a simple matter to
calculate the food requirements of any normal individual.
It is necessary to know the weight of the person in question,
and the manner in which the twenty-four hours are
spent, and, in the case of elderly individuals, make the reductions
believed to be necessary for health.</p>

<p><strong>Method of Using the Tables.</strong>&mdash;Let us take a nurse in
training for this purpose. Suppose the nurse weighs 110
pounds, and spends the twenty-four hours as follows,</p>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Activities during 24 hour period">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Sleeping</td>
    <td class="tdl">8 hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Sitting at meals</td>
    <td class="tdl">2 hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Studying</td>
    <td class="tdl">2 hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">In class</td>
    <td class="tdl">1 hour</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">On duty</td>
    <td class="tdl">9 hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Off duty (walking briskly)</td>
    <td class="tdl">2 hours</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Her daily food requirements would probably be approximately
2,235 calories. This estimate would be increased,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
if she were obliged to do much heavy lifting, scrubbing of
beds, or other duties requiring the expenditure of much
effort. It would be decreased if the hours spent in study
and class room work were increased and the hours on the
ward shortened. The estimation may be made as follows,</p>

<p>This estimate may be made to suit any individual, the
man in the office or the one working on the streets, the
woman living at home or the one spending eight or ten
hours scrubbing the floors of a great office building; it is
simply a matter of adjusting the calories in the dietary to
meet the requirements of body weight and muscular
activity.</p>

<p><strong>Energy Requirements for Children.</strong>&mdash;In estimating
the energy needs of children, the above method is not satisfactory,
since the storage of material for growth must be
considered, as well as the activities of the body. The growth
period includes the years from birth to the eighteenth year,
after which time the food requirements of the body are
made on a basis of weight and muscular activity, as in all
adults. The table on the following page shows the food
allowances made for healthy children; in the feeding of
malnourished or underweight children, more food in proportion
to age is given in order to overcome the handicap
under which they are suffering.</p>

<p>The averages just given are for healthy children; those
who are underweight for their age and height should show
a more rapid increase in weight with an increased food
allowance. It must also be remembered that a simple
gain in weight is not sufficient evidence of a child&rsquo;s normality;
a freedom from gastro-intestinal disturbances, and a
resistance to disease, are equally essential.</p>

<p>There have been tables arranged to show the proper
weight for height for boys and girls of different ages (see
<a href="#table6">appendix</a>). These are valuable since, by their use, attention
is called to the child who is not up to the average.
Medical examination of such children frequently shows reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
for their underweight, and measures may be instituted
which may save the child from a lifetime of poor health.</p>

<p>Dr. Pirquet has arranged a scale (Pelidisi Chart) showing
the state of nutrition in children, based upon the sitting
height (in centimeters), to weight (in kilograms). See <a href="#table9">appendix</a>.</p>


<h3>PROTEIN REQUIREMENTS</h3>

<p>There is never a period in life in which protein is not
needed. During the early years it is essential that the proteins,
or at least a goodly portion of them, be obtained from
animal sources, milk and eggs in particular; when cereals
and legumes (beans and peas) are used to provide for
the protein requirements, they must be supplemented by
milk or eggs (or both), in order that the growth and development
of the child may proceed at a normal rate.</p>

<p>Adults require protein for the repair of old tissues and
to furnish material for the building of new cells, and again
it is believed advisable to have at least a portion of this
protein from animal sources, milk, meat or eggs.</p>


<h3>MINERAL REQUIREMENTS</h3>

<p>Just as energy foods and proteins must be adjusted in
the dietary to safeguard the health of the body, so the mineral
salts must be adjusted for a like purpose. Studies made
of the dietaries of a number of families brought to light
the fact that the children more often suffered from a deficiency
of calcium, phosphorus and iron in their diets
than they did from too little protein,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> proving that it is
quite as essential to adjust the mineral salts in the diet as
it is that of the organic constituents.</p>

<p>According to Sherman the diet of an adult should contain
each day per pound of body weight:</p>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Daily requirements for an adult per pound of body weight">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>Protein</td>
    <td class="tdl">0.5<span class="hide">000</span> gram or more</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Phosphorus</td>
    <td class="tdl">0.01<span class="hide">00</span> gram or more</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Calcium</td>
    <td class="tdl">0.005<span class="hide">0</span> gram or more</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Iron</td>
    <td class="tdl">0.0001 gram or more</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>These averages, while covering the needs of the mature
body, do not furnish the necessary amount of protein, or
mineral salts to support the growth and development of
the child. Hence, it has been deemed advisable to reckon
the requirements of the latter per thousand calories, instead
of per pound of body weight, in this way obviating
some of the danger of protein and mineral deficiencies.</p>

<p>McCollum, Simmonds and Pitz have shown that a deficiency
in the inorganic content of a diet may result in a
retarding or suspension of growth. This result has been
overcome on the introduction of the proper mineral salts
into the diet. This salt mixture is such as to make the
total ash, approximate that found in the composition of
milk ash.</p>

<p>The following diagram illustrates this point.</p>

the estimates for the food requirements of children:</p>

<p><strong>Vitamine Needs.</strong>&mdash;We have seen the manner in which
the energy and protein foods have been adjusted in the
diet, but these can not alone assure the body, and especially
the growing body of a normal maintenance and repair of
its tissue, or support the growth which is essential at this
time. This function is believed to belong to the vitamines,
since feeding experiments have demonstrated the fact that
animals soon cease to grow, develop deficiency diseases, and
finally die, when deprived of the essential constituents.
Gillett advises, as a safe rule, the use of one, and preferably
two foods known to be rich in the fat soluble vitamine, in
each day&rsquo;s food allowance, milk and leafy vegetables, for
example. If the foods containing phosphorus, calcium, and
iron are taken in sufficient quantity, the second, or &ldquo;B&rdquo;
vitamine needs, will probably be adequately covered, but
the presence of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; vitamine must be carefully attended
to; some fresh fruit or vegetables (see table) is
obligatory each day to insure the individual against the
development of scurvy.</p>

<p><strong>Factors Affecting the Food Selection.</strong>&mdash;The estimation
of the energy needs of the body, and the selection of
the foods to furnish the fuel for this purpose, depend
largely upon the individual. The digestion of the fats, as
well as the way in which the body utilizes them, makes the
use of this foodstuff more or less limited according to the
ability of the individual to take care of them, the minimum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
allowance for children being between 2 and 3 ounces per
day. According to Gillett, &ldquo;If boys and girls get at least this
amount from butter and its substitutes, cream, bacon, fat
meat and oils, additional amounts from their food will
provide a margin of safety, without overtaxing the digestive
system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After determining the amount of fat required in each
day&rsquo;s food allowance, it is a simple matter to adjust the
carbohydrates. It is safer from a health standpoint, to
obtain the greater portion of this foodstuff from starchy
foods rather than from the sugars, many foods rich in
starch, likewise contain appreciable amounts of protein and
fat, whereas sugar is practically one hundred per cent. carbohydrate.
The ease, too, with which this substance ferments
in the stomach, and the manner in which it destroys
the appetite for other foods, makes the use of much of it
in concentrated form unadvisable, especially in the diet of
children.</p>

<p>The amount of sugar allowed each day, should be limited
to an ounce or ounce and a half (2 to 3 tablespoonfuls),
and a less quantity is desirable. In order to obtain the
best results, with the least deleterious effect on the body,
it is advisable to give sugar in dilute form. A piece of pure
candy after a meal may not harm the child; but just
before, or between meals, as well as the habit of making
the breakfast cocoa and cereal of syrup-like sweetness is
deplorable, and should in all instances be discouraged.</p>

<p>The American Red Cross recommends the following
method for estimating the amount of sugar in the dietary:
&ldquo;Add one-half the weight of such foods as jellies, jams and
preserves, and three-quarters the weight of such foods as
candy, honey and syrup, to the weight of sugar used.&rdquo;
The amount of sugar consumed, as such, by the adult each
day, is not of such paramount importance as it is in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
case of children, but even for adults an excessive amount of
carbohydrate in this form is not considered advisable from
a health standpoint.</p>

<p>In order to assure each member of the family of getting
all of the materials needed for the growth, repair and regulation
of their bodies, as well as the necessary fuel material
with which to run the engine and to maintain the proper
body temperature, the following practical method is suggested
for the planning of the daily dietary.</p>

<strong>Suggestions for Serving Meals.</strong>&mdash;After reckoning the
number of calories needed for the day, it is well to remember
that the protein must be adequate in type and amount;
that there should be an abundant supply of vitamines and
iron in each day&rsquo;s ration; that milk should always be included
in order to make sure of having a sufficient amount
of calcium in the diet; that there should be only one
heavy protein dish at any one meal, and that it is unwise
to serve a meal in which the fluids predominate on account
of their deficiency in energy and proteins.</p>

<p>If a meal is made up of the right kind of foods, in the
proper proportion, and each individual eats sufficient to
assure the maintenance of the normal weight, is free from
gastro-intestinal disturbances, and shows a normal resistance
to disease, it is more than probable that a sufficient
quantity is being consumed each day.</p>

<p>All foods should be carefully selected, and properly prepared
in order to derive the maximum benefit therefrom, and
the regularity and attractiveness with which the meals are
served have almost as much to do with the health and happiness
of the individual, as the character of the foods included
in the day&rsquo;s dietary.</p>

<br />
METHODS OF FEEDING IN NORMAL AND
ABNORMAL CONDITIONS</h2>


<p>There are several methods of feeding which have been
adopted to meet the needs of the individual under various
conditions: Feeding by mouth, gavage or forced feeding,
rectal feeding (nutrient enemata), and inunction.</p>

<p><strong>Feeding by Mouth.</strong>&mdash;The first method is the one used
in health and in the majority of abnormal conditions. In
cases where there is a certain abnormal development of the
mouth or throat, and in some cases of insanity or unconsciousness,
where for some reason it is impossible for the
individual to swallow, this method cannot be used.</p>

<p><strong>Forced Feeding.</strong>&mdash;With very young children and babies
gavage or forced feeding is found at times to be necessary.
In these cases a small rubber catheter is introduced into the
stomach through the nostrils and the milk or other fluid
poured through the tube. In unconscious or insane patients
it is often found necessary to insert a gag (a cork will serve
the purpose) between the teeth to prevent the biting of the
tube when it is inserted through the mouth into the
stomach.</p>

<p><strong>Food Used for Forced Feeding.</strong>&mdash;The food in these
cases consists of re&euml;nforced soups, milk gruels, or nutrient
beverages, not more than six or eight ounces given at one
time. Finely chopped meat and vegetable pur&eacute;es have
been given in this way when the digestion of the patient
was not impaired, but when conditions rendered it necessary
to resort to this method of feeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
<strong>Technique of Gavage.</strong>&mdash;The apparatus used in gavage
consists of a moderate sized soft rubber tube to which is
attached a rubber or glass funnel and a &ldquo;pinch cock.&rdquo; The
tube should be filled with water to prevent air entering the
stomach and causing pain or discomfort. In certain cases
the patient refuses to swallow the tube and it will be found
necessary to use some means to force the passage if the
throat is shut off. By closing the nostrils the patient will
be obliged to breathe through the mouth, thus opening the
passage into the throat through which the tube may be
quickly slipped. In certain abnormal conditions the gastric
organ is so badly impaired as to render it impossible for
the patient to retain food taken in by way of the mouth.
It is often found that food introduced into the stomach by
means of the &ldquo;stomach tube&rdquo; will be retained and utilized
which otherwise would be rejected. It is disagreeable, however,
and should only be used when it is impossible to feed
otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Rectal feeding</strong> is used when the other organs of digestion
are impaired to such an extent as to render the need of
more food obligatory. Many investigators believe that
rectal feeding is absolutely useless, while others have firm
faith in its efficacy.</p>

<p><strong>Technique of Rectal Feeding.</strong>&mdash;The rectum should be
cleansed by flushing with a soapsuds enema one hour before
the nutrient enema is given. This should be done once a
day, in the morning. The cleansing enema may be either
soapsuds, a solution of bicarbonate of soda, or boric acid (1
teaspoonful to the pint), or a saline solution. When there
is much mucus, or if the rectum is inflamed, the soda or
boric acid solution may be more soothing than the saline or
soapsuds enema. After one hour&rsquo;s rest the patient should
be given a nutrient enema.</p>

<p>The method of administering nourishment through the
rectum is important. A nutrient enema injected only into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
the lower bowel not only does no good, but may actually
cause a good deal of unnecessary discomfort to the patient.</p>

<p><strong>Temperature of Enema.</strong>&mdash;Care must be taken not to
have the temperature of the nutrient enema too hot or
too cold or it will be promptly rejected. The patient is
placed on the side with one knee flexed; the solution is
poured into a fountain syringe bag or an enamel container
(heat the container before pouring the solution into
it or the latter will be chilled). The bag or container has
attached to it a rubber tube with a cock adjusted so
that only a small stream will flow in at a time. To
the end of this tube a rubber rectal tube or catheter&mdash;1 cm.
(about &frac12; inch)&mdash;is attached. This should be well greased
(do not use glycerin as this substance is irritating
to the mucous lining of the rectum). The liquid should
be allowed to fill the tube before it is inserted into the rectum,
to prevent any air passing in with it. The tube should
be inserted with a gentle twisting movement, using very
little force or the tender mucous membranes will be injured.
Insert the tube twelve or more inches, since the solution
is more completely absorbed if given high up in the bowel.
The bag containing the solution should be held only a few
inches higher than the rectum, thus allowing only a small
stream to pass in and allowing an air space above the
stream for the passage of gas which may be accumulated in
the upper part of the rectum. The tube should be allowed
to remain in the rectum for fifteen or twenty minutes, then
very gently withdrawn to prevent the liquid from being
rejected. A pad of gauze may be pressed against the anus
to assist the patient in retaining the enema. It is well to
divert the attention of the patient also, to further assist her
in retaining the liquid.</p>

<p><strong>Duration of Rectal Feeding.</strong>&mdash;Rectal feeding cannot
be substituted for a great length of time, first, because the
patient cannot absorb sufficient nourishment in this way to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
fully cover the body requirements, and, second, because the
rectum becomes more or less sensitive and will reject the
liquid before it has an opportunity to be absorbed. From
three to four nutrient enemas a day is about the limit for
the average patient. Between the nutrient enemas it is
advisable to give one of saline solution.</p>

<p>The following r&eacute;gime is practiced during the &ldquo;Total Abstinence
Period&rdquo; in the treatment of gastric ulcer: 7 <small>A.M.</small>,
cleansing enema; 8 <small>A.M.</small>, nutrient enema; 1 <small>P.M.</small>, nutrient
enema; 3 <small>P.M.</small>, saline enema; 6 <small>P.M.</small>, nutrient enema.
One saline and one nutrient enema may be given during
the night if the patient is very weak. She should not be
wakened, however, to be given the enema.</p>

<p><strong>Feeding by Inunction.</strong>&mdash;This method consists in the
rubbing into the body of certain nutrient oils, such as olive
oil, cocoanut oil, cocoa butter, etc. It is of little value, but
is occasionally resorted to with very much emaciated and
underfed infants, when digestional disorders make it impossible to
introduce enough food by mouth to cover the
needs of the body.</p>


<h3>SPECIAL DIETS</h3>

<p>There are a number of diets formulated to meet the
various normal and abnormal conditions. In hospitals these
are classified as follows, for the convenience of both nurse
and doctor:</p>

<p><strong>House Diet.</strong>&mdash;That which is served to the hospital
staff, the nurses, and those patients not requiring special
diets.</p>

<p><strong>Liquid or Fluid Diet.</strong>&mdash;Consisting of milk, nutrient and
other palatable beverages, broths, and thin gruels.</p>

<p><strong>Light, Semi-solid or Convalescent Diet.</strong>&mdash;Composed
of thick or cream soups, eggs, toast, cereals, custards, jellies
and ice cream, and later vegetable pur&eacute;es, broiled birds,
chicken, lamb chops, and rare beefsteak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
<strong>Mixed Diet.</strong>&mdash;The diet used in normal conditions and
for those not affected by any special food.</p>

<p><strong>Special Diets.</strong>&mdash;Those designed to be used for certain
pathological conditions, such as scarlet fever, nephritis, etc.
These diets are classified as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Milk Diet.</strong>&mdash;A diet in which milk is the sole article of
food.</p>

<p><strong>Carbohydrate-free Diet.</strong>&mdash;One in which the sugars and
starches are eliminated.</p>

<p><strong>Purin-free Diet.</strong>&mdash;One in which the foods rich in purin
bases are eliminated. This is used in gout, arteriosclerosis,
etc.</p>

<p><strong>Salt-free Diet.</strong>&mdash;Diet in which sodium chloride (salt) is
as far as possible excluded. It is used in certain cases of
nephritis when edema is present.</p>

<p><strong>Nephritic Diet.</strong>&mdash;A diet used in nephritis and diseases
complicated by nephritis (scarlet fever). In this diet the
protein foods, meat in particular, are restricted, milk being
the exception.</p>

<p><strong>Diabetic Diet.</strong>&mdash;A diet in which the carbohydrates are
restricted or eliminated.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Allen Treatment of Diabetes&rdquo;</strong> consists chiefly of
&ldquo;starvation&rdquo; for a given period and a re&euml;ducation of the
organs to a toleration for carbohydrates.</p>

<p><strong>Emaciation Diets.</strong>&mdash;Those containing a high percentage
of fat-forming foods, such as milk, cream, eggs,
cereals, potatoes, etc., olive oil.</p>

<p><strong>Obesity Diets.</strong>&mdash;Those containing as few of the fat-forming
foods as possible, such as cream, olive oil, potatoes,
white bread, etc., pastry and desserts, candy and soda water,
and containing lean meats, fish or shellfish cooked and served
without butter or other fats, fresh or stewed fruit without
sugar, green vegetables and salads served without oil or
other fats; one egg a day two or three times a week, coffee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
and tea without sugar or cream, toasted gluten bread (1
slice) without butter, saccharine substituted for sugar.</p>

<p>There are a number of other diets, but they come more
or less under the above heads.</p>


<h3>THE TRAY</h3>

<p>As the patient&rsquo;s tray assumes an important part of the
daily r&eacute;gime, it is necessary to give close attention to the
arrangement and serving of it. There are certain definite
rules to observe: (1) The linen, silver, glassware, china, and
food must be absolutely clean. (2) The tray must be sufficiently
large not to appear crowded. (3) The arrangement
of the obligatory articles, such as salt and pepper, silver,
water glass, napkin, etc., must be alike at every meal; this
not only facilitates the service by making it easy for the
nurse to see whether any of these necessary articles are
left off, but it also enables the patient to find them without
trouble.</p>

<p><strong>The Linen.</strong>&mdash;The linen cover of the tray must be clean
and uncreased. The napkin likewise must be clean and unwrinkled.
The china must be free from chips and cracks.
Care must be taken not to put a collection of odd pieces on
the tray as it gives an untidy appearance.</p>

<p><strong>The Silver.</strong>&mdash;The silver must be bright and in cold
weather made slightly warm, as must also the china. The
chill of cold silver may readily obliterate a fragile appetite,
and to place hot food in cold dishes will deprive it of much
of its palatability. The foods intended to be hot must be
really hot, not warm, and those which are intended to be
cold should be thoroughly chilled before being served to a
patient. The placing of flowers on a tray is a questionable
addition to it; a single flower laid across the folded napkin
may add daintiness and attractiveness, but it is poor judgment
to over-decorate, either with flowers or by garnishing
the dishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
<strong>Arranging the Tray.</strong>&mdash;If the nurse will place the necessary
articles upon the tray and memorize their position so
that she will be able to duplicate the same at each meal, she
will be able to tell at a glance if everything needed is in its
proper place, thereby saving herself unnecessary steps and
the patient the worry of having to wait until they can be
brought. Food should not be allowed to stand in the sickroom,
and glasses or plates in which food has been served
should be removed from sight as soon as the patient finishes
with them. Care must be taken, however, not to create the
impression of hurry or the patient will be made nervous and
either will lose her appetite or have indigestion.</p>

<p>The nurse should be careful of her topics of conversation
during the meal hour. Especially must disagreeable subjects
and business matters be rigidly excluded if the invalid
is to obtain the full benefit of the food served her.</p>

<p>1. <strong>Setting the Tray.</strong>&mdash;Tray should be sufficiently large
not to give the appearance of being crowded, but not
too large.</p>

<p>2. Tray cover must be spotless, and of a size to just cover
the edges of tray; if too large, make a pleat down the
center.</p>

<p>3. Place service plate directly in front of patient.</p>

<p>4. Knife, cutting edge in, to the right of plate; fork, tines
up, to the left of plate.</p>

<p>5. Spoons, bowls up, next to the knife.</p>

<p>6. Napkin on the lower left side of tray, open edges to the
lower right side.</p>

<p>7. Bread and butter plate on top of napkin.</p>

<p>8. Soup tureen in lower right corner, with cup and saucer
above it.</p>

<p>9. Tea or coffee pot and hot water pot in upper right-hand
corner of tray, with sugar bowl next to hot pot and
cream pitcher next to sugar bowl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
10. Place salt and pepper next to cream pitcher (to the
left).</p>

<p>11. Water glass in upper right corner of tray.</p>

<p>12. Second vegetable dish placed on the upper right side
of dinner plate.</p>

<p>13. Place dessert to the upper left of dinner plate.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestions for Serving.</strong>&mdash;Make tray as attractive as
possible.</p>

<p>In the cases requiring special diets, the nurse should
make out the &ldquo;diet sheet&rdquo; for the day. In hospitals this is
passed to the dietitian, who carries out the directions laid
down by the physician. The nurse, however, should carefully
check the tray before serving it, since mistakes sometimes
occur, and to give the wrong food to a patient suffering
from certain disorders may give rise to serious trouble,
causing pain and discomfort and at times death.</p>

<p><strong>Contamination of Food.</strong>&mdash;Food should always be protected
from dirt and dust and from contamination and pollution
from flies and other insects. Typhoid fever and certain
intestinal disturbances have been known to result from
flies coming in contact with raw food&mdash;milk, for example.
Poisoning due to polluted water used to freshen vegetables
has already been spoken of. All of these types of poisoning
may be avoided by using care in the handling of the fresh
foods. <strong>Ptomaines</strong>, however, are not easy to prevent. Their
source cannot always be traced to one particular article of
diet. They may be present in cooked, raw, frozen, or canned
foods. At times the evidence of extreme decomposition
will be found in the foods themselves, while at other times
there will be no such evidence in the food, but the result of
the ptomaine will be perfectly evident whenever certain
individuals partake of that food. This is a personal idiosyncrasy
which it is impossible to account for.</p>

<p><strong>Food Poisoning.</strong>&mdash;Poison caused by decomposed eggs
has manifested itself in individuals who have partaken of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
cake in which such eggs were used. Canned meat and fish
have produced the most violent types of ptomaine poisoning.
As a rule in these cases the canned article has begun
to decompose and while the decomposition may not have
advanced sufficiently far to be discernible from the flavor
or odor, it is there, and if the resistance of the individual
eating this food is not great, serious danger may result.
Poisoning develops in some individuals upon the eating of
shellfish, strawberries, oranges, pimentos, and various other
foods,&mdash;another evidence of personal idiosyncrasy against
certain articles of diet. There is no way to overcome these
idiosyncrasies; the only thing to do is to warn the individuals
so affected to let the offending foods alone.</p>


<h3>ADULTERATION OF FOOD</h3>

<p>The adulteration of food, which formerly was practised
by unscrupulous dealers to cover up inferior articles, or by
manufacturers to prevent or arrest decomposition in canned
goods, is regulated by law. The passage of the National
Pure Food and Drug Act gave the Government authority
to regulate the preservatives and coloring matter used in
canned and bottled goods, forcing the manufacturers to
state on the label the exact contents of each bottle or can.
There are likewise stringent laws governing the adulteration
of milk, butter, and other articles of food.</p>

<p><strong>Tests for Adulterants.</strong>&mdash;Boric acid, borax, and formaldehyde
are the preservatives more often found in milk.
These chemicals are introduced to arrest the natural souring
and decomposition which takes place after milk reaches a
certain age. Occasionally salicylic acid and sodium carbonate
are used. Formaldehyde may be detected by placing
about 20 c.c. of milk in a small glass vessel or tube.
Dilute with an equal amount of pure water, add commercial
sulphuric acid, allowing it to flow gently down the inside of
the tube. A purple ring will appear at the zone of contact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
if formaldehyde is present. &ldquo;Boric acid and borax may be
detected by adding a drop or two of hydrochloric acid to a
few drops of milk in a white dish and then several drops of
a saturated alcoholic solution of <em>turmeric</em>. The dish is then
heated gently for a few minutes, and, if boric acid or borax
is present, a pink or dark red color will appear. A dark
blue-green should appear when the dish is cooled and a drop
of ammonia added.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><strong>Canned goods</strong> must be carefully examined before being
used. The domestic canned goods are rarely adulterated,
but imperfect sterilization and defective cans may bring
about a condition of fermentation and gas formation due to
bacterial action. Cans should have a concave appearance
on the top. If there is a bulging of the can it may be due
to gas formation, and a small hole should be made in the
can to note any escape of this gas. Should there be any
indication of fermentation, the contents should be discarded.
It is advisable to look with suspicion on cans that
appear old, rusty, and soiled; they are probably left-over
stock and liable to be bad. Peas which have been imperfectly
sterilized produce a type of gas which is soluble in the
liquid. After decomposition has occurred there will be no
apparent evidence by the escape of gas, but the liquid will
be found to be excessively acid, and will present a muddy
appearance. Certain foreign importations of canned goods
are preserved in color by the introduction of certain color
preservatives. Peas&mdash;petits pois, for example&mdash;and the
very small string beans which are imported are intensely
green from the copper sulphate used. Its presence may be
detected by adding a few drops of hydrochloric acid to some
of the colored material, then dropping in a bright steel nail,
knitting needle, or knife blade. There will be a deposit of
copper salts (like copper plating) upon the steel if the
preservative is present in the can. Canned corn is often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
artificially sweetened with saccharine, which may be detected
by shaking several tablespoonfuls of the liquid in
an equal amount of chloroform. Saccharine is soluble in
chloroform, while sugar is not. Allow the mixture to stand
a few minutes and remove some of the chloroform which has
settled at the bottom. Place in a small dish, evaporate the
chloroform by gently heating the dish; taste the residue; if
sweet, saccharine is present.</p>

<p><strong>Coffee</strong> is adulterated more often when it is put up in
ground or powdered form than when sold in the bean.
Real coffee contains a small percentage of oil, and will float
when thrown into a glass of water. Substitutes generally
sink to the bottom. Coffee substitutes are often made up
of starch-containing materials, such as cereals, beans and
peas. This starch may be detected by mixing one tablespoonful
of the suspected coffee in a little cold water, adding
one cup of boiling water; allow it to boil two minutes,
filter through cotton, and pass the liquid through charcoal
to remove the color. When it is cold, add a few drops of
dilute iodine solution. If starch is present, a blue color
will appear.</p>


<h3>METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF FOOD</h3>

<p>Food is prepared for consumption by a number of methods
and the method by which the food is prepared either
increases or decreases its digestibility, palatability, and general
usefulness.</p>

<p>Certain foods, as has already been stated, require a high
degree of temperature to make them wholesome, but if this
temperature is applied by means of heated fat, as in frying,
the food is changed from a wholesome to a more or less
indigestible article. In health the organs of digestion are
capable of overcoming much of the harm wrought by wrong
preparation, but even in the healthy, normal individual a
steady diet of fried food will eventually undermine what is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
known as good digestion. In abnormal conditions (illness)
frying is a method seldom, if ever, used.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of Food.</strong>&mdash;The various methods to which
food is subjected in preparation for human consumption
may be summed up as follows: boiling, simmering, steaming,
baking, roasting, broiling, frying, saut&eacute;ing.</p>

<p><strong>Boiling</strong> is cooking in water raised to the boiling point,
212&deg; F. (sterilizing). This method is commonly used in the
cooking of starchy vegetables and cereals, and in the cooking
of green vegetables, such as spinach, carrots, beets,
corn, asparagus, etc. Stewing is a form of boiling. As a
rule water is used, and the vessel is left uncovered, so that
as the food is cooked the surplus moisture evaporates, leaving
the food tender. Dried fruits, such as prunes and apricots,
are prepared by this method.</p>

<p><strong>Simmering</strong> is cooking in water, the temperature of
which is not raised to the boiling point, but kept between
200&deg; F. and 210&deg; F. This method is used in the preparation
of eggs and dishes in which eggs predominate, since
proteins are made tough if subjected to a high degree of
temperature. Coddled eggs, for example, are prepared by
placing the egg in a clean vessel and pouring over it the
boiling water, then covering the vessel and allowing it to
stand for ten or fifteen minutes. The vessel and the cold
egg reduce the temperature of the water to about 185&deg; or
190&deg; F. and in this way prevent a toughening of the albumen
of which eggs are chiefly composed. Soups, broths,
ragouts, etc., are prepared by this method.</p>

<p><strong>Steaming</strong> is cooking over hot water or by steam. This
method may be accomplished on the top of the stove in a
&ldquo;double boiler&rdquo; or in the oven in a deep covered pan fitted
with a &ldquo;rack&rdquo; to hold the article to be cooked. Either
method allows the vessel in which the food is placed to be
surrounded by boiling water, but does not insure sufficient
heat to raise the food within to the boiling point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
<strong>Baking</strong> and <strong>roasting</strong> are both brought about in the oven.
Bread, biscuits, pies and other pastry, potatoes, cakes, etc.,
are baked, while meats, roast of beef, lamb, veal, mutton,
as well as chicken, turkey, duck, and large fish are roasted.
The heat in the oven may be intense. The outside or cut
surface of the meat is seared, the soluble albumens are
coagulated, thus sealing the juices within. If the meat is
placed in a pan surrounded by cold water and then placed in
the oven, the juices are &ldquo;drawn out&rdquo; in the water. These
juices contain the flavoring matter or extractives. Meat
so treated is not so palatable or highly flavored as that
which has first been subjected to intense heat, the water for
the gravy added later.</p>

<p><strong>Frying</strong> and <strong>saut&eacute;ing</strong> is cooking in hot fat. Food may be
fried in deep fat, as is demonstrated in the cooking of croquettes,
doughnuts, etc., or it may be saut&eacute;d in butter or
oil in a shallow frying pan or griddle. The latter method
is used in making hashed brown potatoes, for example; also
in the cooking of griddle cakes, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Broiling.</strong>&mdash;In broiling or grilling the article to be
cooked is exposed to direct heat, either to the blaze or to a
very hot surface. The result is the same as in roasting.
The outer surface is seared, sealing the juices within. Meat
to be broiled is generally cut thinner than that to be roasted.
The article, whether it is meat (steak), chops, birds, or
chicken, is placed about three inches away from the flames
and turned frequently until the surfaces are seared, after
which the article is placed in a cooler part of the stove to
allow the interior to be cooked. Pan broiling is done on
top of the stove. The article to be broiled is placed directly
upon a very hot surface, there is no grease used and the
meat must be turned frequently to prevent burning.</p>

<p><strong>Poaching.</strong>&mdash;This term is applied chiefly to the cooking
of eggs in a shallow pan of water heated just below the boiling
point. To be properly poached an egg must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
perfectly fresh, or the white and yolks will run together and
present an unappetizing, unpalatable appearance.</p>

<p>The following time-table should be used in the preparation
of food to insure correct cooking:</p>

<h3>CARE OF ICE-BOX AND CONTENTS</h3>

<p>The ice-box plays an important r&ocirc;le in the preservation
of the health and comfort of the family, as well as that of
the invalid. Therefore the first consideration is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
cleanliness of it. The old-fashioned boxes were constructed
without ventilation. This was clearly a mistake, since many
foods absorb both the odor and flavor of the substances
about them if allowed to stand for any great length of time
in a closed compartment with them. The ice-boxes or
refrigerators of to-day have a ventilation system which
insures a circulation of air constantly throughout the interior
of the box. The drain pipes require special attention,
because no matter how clean the box itself is kept, the
melting of the ice causes a slime to accumulate on the
inside of the pipe which will clog it and become offensive
unless it is flushed out often. This may be accomplished
by pouring through it a solution made by dissolving one-half
ounce of borax, washing soda, or ammonia in one gallon
of boiling water. The adjustable part of the pipe can be
removed and cleaned with a long brush made for the purpose.
The pipe is then replaced and the boiling water
poured through. In this way the entire drainage system
of the box is completely cleaned. All loose bits of food
which may drop from the containers to the floor and shelves
should be carefully removed each day and the interior of
the box and shelves thoroughly wiped out. Three times a
week is sufficient to wash and flush the box and pipes unless
milk, cream, or other food materials have been spilled, in
which case it should be washed at once before it has an
opportunity to sour or spoil and become offensive. Ice
should always be washed off before being put in the box,
and all milk and cream bottles should likewise be wiped
with a clean wet cloth before being placed on the ice.</p>

<p>Hot food must never be put in the ice-box, as the heat
from the food will raise the temperature of the air in it. In
some cases the sudden chilling of the food itself is undesirable,
but this is not so often the case. However, the
best results are obtained by first allowing the food to cool,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
and then placing it on ice. This is particularly the case
with jellies made from gelatin.</p>

<p>Milk and milk products, cream, butter, buttermilk,
cheese, etc., meat, fish, and, at times, eggs should be kept in
a refrigerator or in a cold place such as the cellar in the
country, when it is impossible to procure ice.</p>

<p>Broths of all sorts, beef juice, and meat jellies will sour
and decompose unless kept close to the ice. Carbonated
waters, such as Vichy, Apollinaris, White Rock, etc., as well
as champagne and other sparkling wines, must be kept in a
dark, cool place, lying on the side. It is better to put only
one or two bottles on the ice at a time, since the wine flattens
(loses its sparkle) if it is ever allowed to become warm
after once being placed on ice. Koumiss and other fermented
milk products must be treated in a like manner to
assure having them served at their best.</p>


<h3>RULES GOVERNING SELECTION OF FOOD</h3>

<p>There are certain fundamental rules to be observed in
the selection of our food materials, whether they are intended
for those in health or for those suffering from pathological
conditions. These rules are definite and obligatory.
All food materials must be of good quality; that is, they
must be of known purity and cleanliness, and adulteration
should not be tolerated. In health the small amount of
preservative used in certain canned and bottled foods would
probably have little if any effect on the individual, but in
sickness this is not always the case. With regard to milk,
this point has particular significance. To obviate danger,
the nurse should use discrimination in the selection of the
dealer from whom the meat, milk, eggs, fruit, and vegetables
are purchased, as well as the grocer who supplies the
remainder of the food materials used by the patient.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE CARE OF FOODS AND UTENSILS</h3>

<p>The next point of consideration is the care of the food
materials. This is quite as important as the selection, for
even the best of food may be ruined by careless handling,
not only in the preparation, but likewise during the period
before it is prepared for the invalid&rsquo;s consumption. The
rules governing the handling of food materials before they
reach the consumer are subject to inspection by law, but
the housekeeper or nurse has no such rules to guard or
govern her; hence she may be wantonly careless or ignorantly
unsanitary unless taught the right way to care for
the food in her charge. Perishable fruits and vegetables
must be kept in a cool place to preserve their freshness.</p>

<p><strong>Method of Washing Dishes.</strong>&mdash;Cleanliness must be observed
in the care of all food materials and the utensils in
which they are to be prepared. If the nurse will observe the
scientific rules governing the solubility of the foodstuffs, she
will be able to save herself much time and trouble. For
example, it is a known scientific fact that starch is insoluble
in cold water and more or less soluble in boiling water,
hence it would be a useless waste of time to try to wash a
utensil in which a starchy food has been cooked in cold
water. Fats solidify under the influence of cold and melt
under the influence of heat, so that hot water should be
used in conjunction with soap or an alkali to remove grease
from dishes and silver and utensils. Albumens are soluble
in cold water and are coagulated in hot, therefore to remove
milk, egg white, and like protein substances from glasses,
spoons, etc., it is advisable to soak first in cold water to wash
out the food material, and then to wash thoroughly in hot
soapsuds to cleanse and polish. The dishcloths used in the
washing and drying of dishes and kitchen utensils should
be washed after using in hot soapsuds, rinsed in clear water,
then dried in the sun. When this is impossible, they should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
at least be hung in the fresh air to make them sweet and
clean before the next using. In contagious diseases the care
of the utensils and dishes used by the patient is of the utmost
importance. They should be thoroughly sterilized
before being placed with those used by the rest of the family,
otherwise the disease may be communicated to the unaffected
members. A word about the handling of glasses
and spoons used in administering medicine in the sickroom:
It is advisable when possible to keep these separate
from those used on the tray, as many medicines have a very
lasting and disagreeable taste, which is more than apt to
cling to the spoons or glasses in which they are measured
and in turn be communicated to the food, making it distinctly
unpalatable. This has been found to be the case with
asafetida, valerian, ichthyol, etc.</p>


<h3>METRIC MEASURE</h3>

<p>The metric system is a system of weights and measures
expressed in the decimal scale. The principal units with
which we are concerned are:</p>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Units of metric measurement">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdc" colspan="2">Milligram&mdash;mgm.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>These units have prefixes to show how they are divided

<h4 class="smcap">Percentage Calculation</h4>

<p>A percentage of a number is the result obtained by taking
the stated number of hundredths of it. The rate per
cent. is a fraction whose denominator is 100 and whose
numerator is the given number of hundredths; thus 6% of
a number is 6/100 of that number.</p>

<p>The method of figuring the per cent. of foodstuffs in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
food material is simple. Milk, for example, has a percentage
composition of 3% protein, 4% fat, and 5% sugar. To find
the definite amounts of these foodstuffs in 1 ounce of
milk it is best to reduce the ounce to grams, since the gram
is the unit of measurement generally used.</p>

<h3>THERMOMETRY</h3>

<p>There are two scales used in thermometry, the Fahrenheit
and the Centigrade. The former is generally used.
However, since many of the scientific calculations are made
using the Centigrade scale it is wise for the nurse to understand
how to translate one to the other.</p>

<p>Centigrade has 0&deg; as the freezing point and 100&deg; as the
boiling point, while Fahrenheit has 32&deg; as freezing point
and 212&deg; as boiling point. To change Fahrenheit to Centigrade
it is necessary to subtract 32 from 212 in order to
make the freezing points correspond. This would read 212
-32 = 180&deg; F. = 100&deg; C; hence a degree Centigrade represents
5/9 of a degree Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>To change Centigrade to Fahrenheit it is necessary to
remember that every Fahrenheit degree is 9/5 times as large
as the Centigrade and the addition of 32&deg; must also be
made. For example: Change 105&deg; F. to Centigrade:
105&deg;-32&deg; &times; 5/9 = 41&deg; C. Change 50&deg; C. to Fahrenheit:
50&deg; &times; 9/5 + 32&deg; = 90&deg; + 32&deg; = 122&deg; F.</p>

<br />
FOOD MATERIALS AND THEIR PREPARATION</h2>


<p><strong>Dairy Products.</strong>&mdash;Milk, cream, and other dairy products
form such an important part of the invalid dietary
that they require especial care in their selection. &ldquo;Certified
Milk&rdquo; is the safest. This is protected by special inspection.
The methods and standards governing the production
and distribution of certified milk were adopted by
the American Association of Medical Milk Commissions,
May 1, 1912. The sanitary condition of the dairy, the
cleanliness of the vessels into which the milk is placed, the
health of the milkers, and a surety that no member of
their family with whom they come in contact has any kind
of contagious disease, are all obligatory. The feed for the
cows and the purity of the water given them to drink must
be inspected and made to conform to the standard laid
down for certified milk. The milk of sick cows and those
having tuberculosis is absolutely condemned. The composition
of certified milk is standardized as follows: the fat
standard shall be 4%, with a permissible range varying
from 3.5% to 4.5%. The proteins shall be 3.5%, with a
permissible range varying from 3% to 4%. Certified milk
shall not contain more than 10,000 bacteria to the cubic
centimeter when it is delivered. This inspection and standardizing
necessarily raises the price of certified milk above
that of milk not so rigidly cared for, and when the additional
expense makes it impossible for the patient to afford certified
milk, the only thing to do is to be sure of the reliability
of the dealer from whom the milk is purchased and the
cleanliness of the dairy from which it is procured. Buttermilk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
and butter are the milk products which require some
attention as to selection. The former grows sour with age
and the odor of advanced fermentation and decomposition
is readily recognized. Sweet butter, butter without salt, is
less apt to be old when purchased than the salted variety, as
the flavor of rancid fat is unmistakable in butter which has
not been especially treated.</p>

<p><strong>Milk.</strong>&mdash;Milk is without a doubt the most valuable food
in the invalid dietary, furnishing not only a highly nutritious
beverage, but likewise acting as a carrier of additional
nourishment when such is necessary. Its form, its lack of
definite flavor and odor, all add to its value as a food in
sickness. Milk is one of the few foods which includes in
its composition all of the chemical combinations known as
foodstuffs. The carbohydrates, comprising 4.88% to 5%
of the solids in milk, occur as lactose or milk sugar. This
sugar belongs to the disaccharide group, and is, in the majority
of cases, readily digested by even the most delicate
digestive apparatus. This form of sugar lends itself particularly
well as a reinforcing agent, and is generally used
in such cases as typhoid fever, etc. The fat in milk, comprising
4% of the solids and occurring as butter fat (cream),
is made up chiefly of olein and of palmitin, with smaller
amounts of stearin and from 5% to 6% of its composition
in the form of butyric acid (the fatty acid to which butter
owes its name and flavor) and traces of other fatty acids,
as well as small quantities of cholesterin, lecithin, and a yellow
coloring matter.</p>

<p>The proteins of milk, which form the curd or larger part
of the solids, according to Van Slyke<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> are in the form of
casein and albumen. There are 3.6 parts casein to 1 part
soluble proteins, but these figures vary somewhat at times.
Casein is insoluble in pure water, but dissolves readily in
water to which an alkali or calcium carbonate is added. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
soluble protein in the form of lactalbumen is one of the
constituents of whey. This substance contains more sulphur
than does casein, but no phosphorus.</p>

<p><strong>Whey</strong> is the opalescent fluid which remains when the
casein is precipitated, and is composed of water 93.8%, total
ash 0.44% (K&ouml;nig).</p>

<p><strong>Mineral salts</strong>, 0.7% of milk, are made up of calcium,
potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, sulphur, phosphorus,
and chlorine. Milk is so rich in calcium that it requires
only 400 c.c. (or about 2&frac12; cups) to furnish 1 gram of
calcium. This is the amount believed to be necessary for
the welfare of man each day and this must be derived from
food.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><strong>Water.</strong>&mdash;The fluid part of milk is composed chiefly of
water, constituting 87% of whole milk.</p>

<p>Milk as a food for infants will be discussed in another
chapter.</p>

<p>As has already been said, no food has so far been discovered
which could be effectually substituted for milk.
There is no food, however, which requires more attention
in its selection and care. It is very susceptible to both
odors and flavors, absorbing them both readily, as will be
found if milk be placed in the same compartment with
foods of strong odor and flavor, without being properly
covered and protected. This is particularly noticeable with
cucumbers, melons, etc.</p>

<p>Milk also furnishes a splendid medium for bacterial
growth, and if left exposed to the air, put into unclean receptacles,
or kept in a warm place, will immediately become
more or less contaminated, after which it is unwise
to use it. Sterilization and pasteurization will in a measure
overcome the bacterial contamination, but milk purchased
from a dairy which is not clean or milked under
unsanitary conditions will remain dirty, hence unfit for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
human consumption. When the morning&rsquo;s milk supply is
brought to the house it should be in clean, well-stoppered
bottles, but before placing it in the ice-box the tops of the
bottles should be carefully wiped off with a wet cloth to
remove any superficial dust which may be adhering to them.
Every time a portion of the milk is removed thereafter the
tops should be again cleansed before the milk is poured
out. This is a wise precaution, and often prevents contamination
from the hands, etc.</p>

<p>The amount of water in milk prevents its being an adequate
food for adults except in certain pathological conditions.
However, it furnishes a supplementary food unequaled
by any other beverage known. There are fortunately only
a few individuals who are unable to drink milk. There are
many who fancy they cannot do so, but if the nurse has
the ingenuity to utilize some of the various methods
whereby milk is made more digestible, it will generally be
found that the patient can take it without trouble. In
cases of personal dislike, if the milk is flavored or colored or
made up into soup, cocoa, chocolate, junket, custards, blanc-mange,
etc., it will usually prove acceptable.</p>

<p><strong>Application of Heat.</strong>&mdash;A word as to the changes which
are brought about as the result of heat as applied to milk.
These changes are demonstrated in the two methods commonly
used in the preparation of milk known as &ldquo;pasteurization&rdquo;
and &ldquo;sterilization.&rdquo; Pasteurization is rather an indefinite
term to use, unless the time and the temperature
to which the milk is subjected are given. According to
Morse and Talbot &ldquo;the term sterilization should never be
applied to the processes used in the preparation of milk for
the feeding of infants, because the milk is never rendered
bacteriologically sterile by them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>As a rule the flavor and odor of milk are not changed by
heat until the temperature reaches nearly to the boiling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
point. A scum then forms on boiling milk, composed of
casein 50.86%, fatty matter 45.42%, ash 4.72% (Rosenau).
Prolonged boiling changes the color of milk from a creamy
white to a yellowish brown which deepens with boiling.
This is due to the caramelization of the milk sugar. Cream
will not rise (or its rise will be very slow) on milk which
has been subjected to a temperature of 150&deg; F. for thirty
minutes or more because the fat droplets are broken down
so that they cannot hold together at that temperature and
become more completely distributed throughout the fluid.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><strong>Pasteurization</strong> is acknowledged to be preferable to
sterilization in milk used for infant feeding because the
higher the temperature the greater the change in the chemical
composition of the fluid. According to Morse and
Talbot<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> the temperature of the pasteurization should be
as low as possible. Pasteurization at 140&deg; F. for 20 minutes
is sufficient; lower temperatures are not. &ldquo;At this
temperature there is no change in the taste, odor, or color
of the milk, no noteworthy changes in the chemical composition
are produced, the ferments and bactericidal action are
unaffected and bacterial toxins and non-spore-bearing
microorganisms are destroyed.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Rosenau<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> states that the bacillus of typhoid, diphtheria,
and dysentery, as well as the cholera vibrio and other pathogenic
non-spore-bearing bacteria which are often found in
milk, are destroyed at a temperature of 140&deg; F. for twenty
minutes, and at higher temperatures for shorter lengths of
time.</p>

<p>Sommerfield&rsquo;s<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> investigations prove that butyric acid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
bacilli are destroyed at a temperature of 212&deg; F. for from 1
to 2 minutes.</p>

<p>It must be understood that no matter what method is
used to insure purity in milk, nothing does away with the
necessity for keeping the milk both clean and cold. The
receptacles in which the milk is allowed to stand, the vessels
in which it is measured, and the person who handles
it must be absolutely clean, and the nurse must keep in
mind the fact that pasteurization does not completely destroy
the bacterial growth in milk, that it merely diminishes
it, and she must see that the milk which has undergone the
pasteurizing process is kept cold, otherwise the micro&ouml;rganisms
which are present, even if to a less extent than in
raw milk, will undoubtedly multiply.</p>

<p><strong>Adulteration of Milk.</strong>&mdash;There is not nearly so much
adulteration of milk to-day as there was a few years ago.
The stringent laws governing the care and composition of
the milk make it unprofitable for the dairymen to practise
it. However, there are times when such things are done
and care must be taken to prevent it. Milk is, as has
already been stated, very susceptible to contamination, and
that which is infected with putrefactive bacteria is not fit
for food even if the dealer has doctored it with formaldehyde.
However, the danger to-day is not so much from
drugs as from lack of care in the handling of the milk. It
is well to remember, however, that water is an adulteration
just the same as formaldehyde and perhaps more pernicious,
since the quantities of the latter are so small in an ordinary
quantity of milk as not to make a great deal of difference
except in the feeding of invalids and children, while watered
milk is a swindle not only to the pocketbook but to the body
also, since the requisite nutritive value is lacking.</p>

<p><strong>Selection and Care of Milk.</strong>&mdash;There are a few essential
facts to keep in mind in regard to milk: (1) Be sure
of the source of the milk supply, especially in the feeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
of the sick and of infants. Milk for such cases should always
be purchased from inspected dairies when it is possible.
(2) Keep the milk cold; the best milk in the world will
spoil if left in a warm place. (3) Always keep the milk
bottle well covered, thus eliminating the danger of contamination,
flies, etc.</p>

<h3>Eggs</h3>

<p><strong>Eggs.</strong>&mdash;The table shows eggs to have a chemical composition
of water 73.7%, protein 14.8%, fat 10.5%, and
mineral salts (ash) 1.0%. Fuel value per pound, 672 calories.
The white of the egg, constituting 57% of the
entire weight, is composed chiefly of albumen and water
with a small percentage of mineral salts in the form of
calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus,
chlorin, sulphur, and iron. Typical albumens are always
rich in sulphur, and in eggs the sulphur content is much
greater in the egg white than it is in the yolk. The yolk of
eggs contains more protein and fat than the white, and less
water. The protein of the yolk is chiefly in the form of
ovovitellin, while the fats occur as palmitin, olein, and
stearin. There is also 5% of coloring matter in the yolk of
eggs besides lecithin, nuclein, salts of iron, potassium, magnesium,
and phosphorus. The latter mineral salt comprises
1.0% in yolk, while in the white there is only .03%. Eggs
have a position in the invalid dietary second only to that
of milk. They are nutritious, easy of digestion, and exceedingly
palatable if properly selected and correctly prepared.
The albumen in the white is very susceptible to the
effect of heat. At a temperature of about 135&deg; F. the clear,
pale yellowish white begins to change to an opalescent tint,
and, as the temperature is gradually increased, the texture
changes from a viscid, sticky substance to an opaque, jelly-like
mass which solidifies with an ever increasing temperature.
Hard cooked white of egg, unless it is very finely
divided, is considered difficult of digestion, but if the heat
is applied gradually and is not raised to the boiling point
(212&deg; F.) there is no reason why the hard cooked white of
the egg should not be digested. However, it is unwise to
cook eggs in this manner for invalids or children. Any of
the other methods, with the exception of frying, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
should never be used, is decidedly preferable. Egg albumen
is soluble in water and fresh fruit juices, so that it may be
used with great success as a reinforcing agent. In fact, the
whole egg may be so used, but it is more difficult to disguise
the yolk in a beverage than it is the white, and for this
reason it is not so adaptable in many cases. Eggs may be
cooked by the following methods in the invalid dietary:
coddled, soft-cooked, poached, creamed, omelet, scrambled,
or in custard. Uncooked eggs may be given in water, milk,
wine, or fruit juices.</p>

<p>The selection of eggs is equally as important as the
selection of other foods. There are &ldquo;new-laid eggs,&rdquo; &ldquo;fresh
eggs,&rdquo; and just &ldquo;eggs.&rdquo; The latter are generally storage and
should not be used for the sick or for infants. As a rule
old eggs will not stand poaching, the whites and yolks
mingle and form an unappetizing mass. It does not make
any difference whether the color of the shell is white or
brown; if the egg is absolutely fresh the white and yolk
should be distinct and easily separated, and when they are
not it is safer to discard the egg entirely.</p>

<h3>Meats</h3>

<h4 class="smcap">Beef, Lamb, Veal, Poultry, Fish and Shellfish</h4>

<p><strong>Meats.</strong>&mdash;The flesh of animals, poultry, and fish comes
under the head of meat. These food materials form one of
the most important sources of protein in the diet, the foodstuff
being in concentrated form easily handled by the digestive
apparatus and absorbed almost completely, leaving
little residue in the intestinal tract. The chemical composition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
of different meats is very much alike, as will be seen in
the table, the bulk of the weight being water, while the
proteins range from 18.3% (E.P.)<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> in beef to 9.9% in
bacon. The fats range from 17.9% in beef to 64.8% in
smoked bacon.</p>

<p>The mineral salts or ash, as they are found in meat:
&ldquo;Sodium occurs in the animal body chiefly as chlorid in the
fluids and blood, and to a less extent in the other tissues.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Potassium, on the other hand, is much more abundant in
the soft solid tissues, in the corpuscles of the blood and the
protoplasm of the muscles and other organs.&rdquo; &ldquo;Potassium
sulphate in the blood reacts to some extent with sodium
chlorid, forming potassium chlorid and sodium sulphate,
both of which are rapidly eliminated by the kidneys.&rdquo; The
greater part of the sulphur with which we are concerned in
nutrition enters the body by way of the protein, the percentage
in lean beef being from 0.95% to 1.00%.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Phosphorus
in meat occurs as phosphoprotein in the nucleoproteins
of cell nuclei, and lecithoproteins in the brain and
to a less extent in other tissues as phosphorized fats. Meat
is poor in calcium, containing only about 0.01 gram per
hundred grams of substance. Meat with eggs yields a considerable
amount of what is known as acids in the body.</p>

<p><strong>Quality of Meats.</strong>&mdash;The quality of meat depends upon
several factors: <em>age</em>, <em>sex</em>, care, feeding, and the length of
time it is hung. Cold storage beef is much more apt to be
tender than that cut from a freshly killed animal. Animals
that are not allowed to run over a large area, but are kept
in a small inclosure and fed on fattening foods, produce
meat of a high quality. This is because the muscular tissue
has not been hardened with exercise. The worked muscle
is always tougher than the quiet one. For this reason the
tenderloin of beef is more tender than the flank. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
situated in the part of the animal that is exercised the least.
The tough parts, however, are not lacking in flavor or
nourishment, but the manner in which they must be cooked
to assure them of being tender deprives them of much of
their original flavor. This is demonstrated in broths and
soups made from the tough cuts of meat. The extractives
from which meat derives its flavor and the soluble albumens
are drawn out by the water, and if it is to be used as hash,
croquettes, etc., needs to be seasoned, since the broth, while
it has taken very little of the actual nourishment from the
meat, has deprived it of practically all of its flavor. In
making broth or soup, if the meat is covered with cold water
instead of hot, more of the extractives will be drawn out and
the broth will be more highly flavored and much more
stimulating. The color, odor, and freshness of the muscular
and fatty tissues of meat are all indicative of their quality.
Fresh meat is firm in texture and free from offensive odor.
Stale beef and that cut from an old steer exhales a pungent
odor of butyric acid. The color of beef should be dark
purplish when fresh cut but this changes quickly to a bright
red; it should contain preservatives of no kind and must be
cut from animals free from all disease. The fat should be
of a yellowish white and be crumbly, and should be distributed
throughout the muscular tissue and around the
organs.</p>

<p><strong>Veal</strong>, being the flesh of an immature creature, is not so
highly flavored as the flesh of older animals, but the bones
and cartilages are softer, and when this meat is used for
broth, more of the gelatin (collagen and elastin from the
bones and connective tissue) is dissolved out, giving a
slightly higher percentage of nutriment in the broth.</p>

<p><strong>Selecting of Chicken and Turkey.</strong>&mdash;In selecting
chicken for the diet of invalids, use only the young birds for
broiling, those a few months older for baking and roasting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
and the fowls for soup and broth. To test a chicken for
broiling and roasting, select one in which the cartilage at
the end of the breastbone is soft and pliable; the pinions
(lower part of the wings) and the feet should be soft and
readily bent. The breastbone of a fowl is firmer and the
wings and feet harder than those of the younger chicken.
The young chicken has an abundance of pin feathers while
the old fowl has not. In fact, one of the means of differentiating
between the old chicken and the young, even
if they are practically of the same weight, is the presence
of the long hairs instead of pin feathers. The fowl
selected for broth should not be very fat, as this fat will
melt into the broth, causing it to be greasy and unpalatable.
Turkey, even when it is young, is not quite so digestible as
young chicken; the fibers are longer and the connective
tissue more abundant. Goose and duck are richer in fat and
not so desirable as chicken in the invalid dietary. Squab,
quail, and young squirrel are all palatable and readily digested.
The squirrel must, however, be young, or the flesh
will be tough and more difficult of digestion.</p>

<p><strong>Fish.</strong>&mdash;Fish should be given consideration in the dietary
of the invalid since it is a valuable source of protein and
readily digested in the majority of cases. As a rule fish is
not so well liked as meat, but since it contains a smaller percentage
of <strong>extractives</strong> and <strong>purin</strong> bases it is exceedingly
valuable in certain pathological conditions. The lean varieties
of fish, halibut, flounder, trout, perch, haddock, turbot,
whitefish, are more readily digested than the dark fish,
which contain a higher percentage of fat. To this latter
class belong the bluefish, mackerel, salmon, shad, and herring.</p>

<p><strong>Shellfish.</strong>&mdash;Of the shellfish, the oyster and the clam are
exceedingly useful. The soft parts of the oyster are palatable
and easily digested. They are not highly nutritious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
but give a nice variety to the diet. When used in broth or
for the juice, clams are particularly useful. Many cases of
nausea are relieved by the taking of iced or very hot clam
juice when they resist other remedies. The necessity of
having both oysters and clams absolutely fresh is of the
greatest importance, since a type of poison results from
tainted shellfish which is exceedingly dangerous.</p>

<p><strong>Pork in the Diet.</strong>&mdash;Fresh pork is rarely ever included
in the invalid dietary save in diabetic diets. Meat from
this animal must always be thoroughly cooked, not only
because underdone pork is exceedingly indigestible but because
there is an infectious bacterium sometimes found in
pork which is only destroyed by thorough cooking of the
meat. Well-cooked bacon is digestible if the surplus fat is
poured off instead of allowed to soak into the cooked bacon.
The most efficient method of cooking bacon is to place the
strips upon a broiler under the flame. In this way the hot
fat drips down into the pan beneath, leaving the bacon crisp
and delicate.</p>

<p>The meats to be used for the invalid must be selected
with care. The quality of this item of food is most important.
It is not always necessary to purchase the most expensive
cut. If it is to be broiled or roasted then it is
necessary to select parts of the animal which are tender, but
for broths, soups, scraped or ground meat, or the meat to
be used for the juice only, it is wasteful to buy these tender,
expensive pieces when those costing less will serve the purpose
equally well. The names given to the different cuts
vary slightly in different parts of the country, but those in
general use only will be mentioned here. The following
table shows the manner in which the <strong>beef</strong> is cut and the
method in which it is generally used:</p>

<h3>Broths and Soups</h3>

<h4 class="smcap">Standard Broth<br />
Beef, Veal, Mutton, or Chicken</h4>

<p class="center"><i>1 Pint, 80 calories, with rice or barley 105 calories</i></p>

<p>Two pounds of meat (beef, mutton, veal, or chicken);
2 quarts of water; 2 pounds of bones; 1 teaspoonful of salt;
2 tablespoonfuls of rice or barley may be added if desired
and parsley or celery may be used to give the additional
flavor.</p>

<p>Wipe meat with a clean wet cloth and cut into small
pieces, break the bones, place all together in a deep saucepan,
cover closely and allow to stand in a cool place for one
hour; then place pan on the back part of the stove, or on
an asbestos mat over a gas burner, and heat gently to the
boiling point (broth must never do more than simmer),
allow to simmer for three or four hours, skim, strain, and
cool. When thoroughly cold, remove all of the fat, using
blotting paper to absorb the fine particles of grease. If
parsley and celery are to be used to flavor the broth they
may be added during the last hour of cooking. Barley requires
to be soaked overnight when it is used in broth;
rice should be soaked one hour. When either are to be left
in the broth it is better to cook the broth for three hours,
strain, return to the fire, adding the rice or barley. Allow
it to simmer for an hour or more and proceed as directed.
When the broth is taken from the fire, it should be measured,
and boiling water added to bring the amount up to the
original quantity. This will give what is known as standard
broth. Bouillon is clarified broth, most of the already
small amount of nutrient material being thus strained and
cleared from the broth, leaving a liquid of practically no
fuel value.</p>

<h4 class="smcap">Broiled Quail or Squab</h4>

<p class="center"><i>418-543 calories</i></p>

<p>Split down the back and place on the broiler, cut surface
uppermost. Or place upon a hot pan, cut surface next to
the hot surface so that the cut side may sear quickly, thus
keeping in the juices instead of having them wasted in the
pan by slow cooking. The process requires about 15 to 20
minutes. Serve on toast, with butter, pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Quail or squab cooked inside the stove is often more
palatable than that cooked on a broiler. The bird is split
as for broiling, and placed in a small pan just large enough
to hold it; a strip of bacon pinned about the breast; add 1
tablespoonful of butter in bits, dust the cut surface first
with salt and pepper, then with flour; add &frac12; cup of hot
water. Turn another pan over the bird (it must fit closely
to keep in the steam), place inside the oven and cook about
10 minutes; turn the bird over and cook 10 minutes longer.
Lift the bird from the pan and place it where it will keep
hot, add a tablespoonful more water and a teaspoonful
more flour to the gravy in the pan, stir briskly to remove
any lumps, remove bacon and place the bird upon a slice
of nicely browned toast; pour over it the gravy, garnish
with a sprig of parsley, and serve at once.</p>

pan; allow to steam for about 1 hour, lift from hot water
pan and place in oven or under the flames to brown lightly.
Serve on buttered toast.</p>


<h4 class="smcap">Chicken (one-half)</h4>

<p class="center"><i>355 calories</i></p>

<p>Split small chicken (broiler) down the back, flatten the
breast bone with knife before placing upon the broiler,
proceed as in broiling birds, allowing from 25 to 30 minutes
for the process. Chicken is very palatable and dainty if
cooked after the manner described in cooking quail and
squab inside the stove. The process is called smothering.
Serve upon buttered toast, garnished with parsley.</p>


<h4 class="smcap">Roast Chicken, Turkey or Duck</h4>

<p>Draw the fowl and wash thoroughly inside and out.
(If it is purchased from the market, it is well to wash the
inside with soda water to remove any stale flavor that may
be present.)</p>

<p>Make a dressing from one-third of a small loaf of bread
broken into small pieces; &frac14; cup chopped celery, 1 tablespoonful
of chopped parsley, 1 tablespoonful of butter and
one egg beaten lightly. Stuff the cavity with dressing, sew
up the opening and place in dripping pan. Place pan under
the flame for a few minutes to brown, unless a regular
roasting pan (savory roaster) is used; allow to bake from
45 minutes to an hour and a half for chicken and duck
according to the size, and from an hour and a half to three
hours for turkey according to size. A cupful of boiling water
may be poured into the pan in which the chicken, etc., is
being roasted and flour may be sifted over the top; dust
with salt and pepper. When an ordinary pan is used for
baking, the fowl will require frequent basting to keep it
moist and tender. Just as the baking is finished, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>

ten as the clock ticks and turn the steak over, count ten
again and again turn; continue this for about 3 minutes
or until the steak is seared upon both sides, lift the broiler
to a lower part of the oven and continue the cooking for
5 to 8 minutes; run a sharp-pointed knife between the
meat and the bone (if the steak is a porterhouse or sirloin),
and if the flesh is red, continue the cooking a minute or
more. If it is pink, lift to a hot plate, place 1 teaspoonful
of butter upon it, dust the surface with salt and pepper and
serve hot. Pan broiling is done on the top of the stove in a
flat frying pan. Wipe the pan with a clean wet cloth, place
upon the stove and heat piping hot, and place the steak
(without greasing the pan) upon the hot surface. Proceed
as in broiling under the flame. After the first 3 minutes of
cooking, place the pan on a cooler part of the stove to finish
the cooking.</p>


<h4 class="smcap">Lamb or Mutton Chops</h4>

<p class="center"><i>2 chops, 304 calories</i></p>

<p>1 to 2 inches thick will require from 10 to 15 minutes&rsquo;
cooking. Scrape the bone clean and wrap in paper or dough
to prevent the bone from becoming charred. Proceed as in
cooking beefsteak.</p>


<h4 class="smcap">Veal Cutlets</h4>

<p class="center"><i>2 cutlets, 275 (about) calories</i></p>

<p>Dip cutlets first in egg (mix one yolk with 1 tablespoonful

frying pan slightly), or broil under the flame as directed in
cooking beefsteak. Veal cutlets may be served plain, or
with tomato sauce.</p>

<p>Cutlets or chops may be cooked in paper bags if desired.
Wrap the chop in a thin slice of bacon, grease the paper (a
piece of heavy brown paper), place the chop inside and
secure the ends with paper clips or pins; place in a pan and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
cook in the oven, or under the flame. It is wise to slip the
bag containing the chop inside of another bag; in this way
the meat will not taste of scorched paper if the outer bag
should burn.</p>


<h4 class="smcap">Bacon (1 Slice)</h4>

<p class="center"><i>194 calories</i></p>

<p>Place bacon on a rack and place rack in a dripping pan,
set in oven and bake until crisp and brown. Or, arrange
bacon on broiler, place pan beneath to catch the drippings
and prevent the fat from catching afire, broil as beefsteak.</p>


<p class="hrpad">When steak or chops are served, parsley or sliced lemon
may be used as garnishes. Chops may be served garnished
with green peas, and the beefsteak served with potatoes
cooked in any way; all meats should be served very hot. It
is best to cover with a plate.</p>


<h3>Fish</h3>

<p>Split down the back, and broil as beefsteak. Fish does

<h3>Vegetables and Fruits</h3>

<p>Among the plants known as vegetables, some are seeds,
some leaves, some stems or bulbs, some roots or tubers, and
some are the fruit surrounding the seeds. Under the head
of seeds we find peas, beans and lentils, this class of vegetables
being spoken of as legumes or pulses; they are rich in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
protein (especially when dried) and contain an appreciable
amount of carbohydrates as well, some contain fat. Green,
or fresh legumes are more easily digested than the dried
legumes. They are important sources of iron and phosphorus
and contain a certain amount of calcium; in the
body they act as neutralizing agents since the base-forming
elements in these plants predominate over the acid-forming
elements.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Among the &ldquo;leafy vegetables&rdquo; we find, lettuce, cabbage,
spinach, beet, turnip and mustard greens, chard and parsley.
These vegetables are not only prized for their mineral content
but furnish a recognized source of the fat soluble
vitamine, &ldquo;A.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tomatoes, squash, cucumbers and pumpkin are vegetables
whose &ldquo;fleshy fruit&rdquo; surround the seed but are eaten
as vegetables instead of as fruit.</p>

<p>Potatoes, carrots, parsnips, onions, beets and turnips
are among those whose stems, roots or tubers are eaten as
vegetables.</p>

<p>More and more are we coming to see the importance
of this class of foods in the dietary, they are important
on account of their mineral salts, their vitamine factors
and for the bulk which they lend to the food mass which
facilitates its passage along the digestive tract. The
majority of vegetables furnish organic acids or their salts
which function in the body, as potential bases, assisting
in the neutralization of the acids formed in the body as a
result of the breaking down of the proteins.</p>

<p><strong>Fruits.</strong>&mdash;Fruits have practically the same value from
a dietetic standpoint as vegetables, and the same care must
be given to their selection. Some fresh fruit should be
given to children every day to safeguard them against
scurvy. And adults should have fresh fruit several times
a week, the remainder of the time dried fruits may be used.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
Canned fruits while good are not so valuable as fresh fruits
and are more expensive than the dried fruit.</p>

<p>The <strong>fruits and vegetables</strong> will here be considered. Some
of the fruits and vegetables contain high percentages of
sugar, aside from the mineral salts, for which they are
especially valuable. This class includes the sugar cane,
sugar beet, raisins, dates, figs, etc., while others such as the
potato, taro, banana, etc., furnish an appreciable amount of
starch. All of the vegetables and fruits are rich in mineral
salts, which are as important to the work of the body as
the proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Hence it is essential
to add the foods containing these mineral salts to the daily
dietary both in health and in disease.</p>

<p>Both fruits and vegetables should be free from blemishes.
Those to be served raw, such as lettuce and other salad
vegetables, must be purchased from reliable markets. Unscrupulous
vendors have been known to sprinkle old wilted
vegetables, to restore their freshness, with water from stagnant
pools teeming with typhoid bacteria, thereby spreading
infection broadcast. Vegetables which require cooking
before they are eaten are, for this reason, safer.</p>

<p><strong>Canned foods</strong> should be avoided in the diet of the invalid
whenever it is possible; but, when it is not, care should be
observed that no can is used in which there is the least
sign of fermentation. Beans and peas are sometimes artificially
colored, but this custom is not so prevalent now as
it used to be.</p>

Add salt and peas to boiling water; allow to cook from
30 to 60 minutes, or until they are perfectly tender, drain
and add butter and additional salt if necessary, or 1 tablespoonful
of cream sauce. In gastro-intestinal disorders

<p>Whipped cream may be added to dressing before serving.
Mayonnaise will keep if placed in a cool place, and the

INFANT FOODS AND FORMULAS USED IN
ABNORMAL CONDITIONS</h2>

<h3>Formulas Used In Feeding Infants</h3>


<h4 class="smcap">Whey</h4>

<p>Put one pint of skimmed milk into a clean saucepan and
heat to a temperature of 100&deg; F. (lukewarm). To this
milk add 2 teaspoonfuls of liquid rennet, essence of pepsin,
or 2 junket tablets, stir until well mixed, and allow to
stand at room temperature (70&deg; F.) until firmly jellied.
Break up with a fork until it is finely divided, strain
through thicknesses of cheesecloth; return the fluid part to
the stove and raise to a temperature of 150&deg; F. to destroy
the rennet left in the whey. The whey is then cooled before
it is added to the milk or cream.</p>


<h4 class="smcap">Barley Water</h4>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Ingredients">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">3% decoction starch<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">4 rounded tsp. barley flour</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">1 pt. water</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Mix a small amount of the water with the barley flour
and put the rest of the water into a clean saucepan and
allow to heat; when boiling add thin barley mixture, stir
thoroughly, and allow to boil 20 minutes; remove from
stove, measure, and replace with hot water that which was
lost through evaporation to make up the original pint;
strain through two thicknesses of cheesecloth.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="smcap">Oat Water</h4>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Ingredients">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">4 rounded tsp. oat flour</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">1 pt. water</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Mix and proceed as in making barley water.</p>


<h4 class="smcap">Albumen Water with Brandy</h4>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Ingredients">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">8 oz. water (cold)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">1 egg white</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">1 tsp. brandy</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Mix egg and water and add brandy slowly to prevent
coagulating egg white.</p>


<h4 class="smcap">Beef Juice</h4>

<p>Composition: 0.60% fat, 2.90% protein, and considerable
extractive matter.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Place a piece of round steak upon a hot griddle and
turn once or twice until the outside is seared and the meat
is hot throughout. Remove from griddle and cut into small
pieces and place in a small meat press made for the purpose.
A lemon squeezer may be used when the press is
not available. Salt lightly. Begin by giving one teaspoonful
and increase the amount gradually to 1 ounce (6 teaspoonfuls).
According to Morse and Talbot, it is never
wise to give babies more than 2 ounces of beef juice even
in their second year, as it is apt to disturb digestion. Also
babies are often made restless or sleepless by taking beef
juice.</p>


<h4 class="smcap">Malt Soup</h4>

<p class="center"><i>347 calories</i></p>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Ingredients">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">1&frac12;-2 tbs. malt soup extract (reduce if necessary)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">1 level tbs. sifted flour</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">1 pt. milk</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">18 oz. water (hot and cold)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
Dissolve malt soup extract in &frac12; cup of hot water and
measure in enough cold water to cool the mixture. With
the remaining cold water mix the flour until it is free from
lumps; and to the malt soup mixture, add milk. Pour all
into a clean saucepan and bring slowly to the boiling point;
simmer (not boil) for 20 minutes. Now increase the heat
and allow the mixture to boil 5 minutes; strain and use as
directed.</p>

<p>This is a fattening mixture and the amount of malt
soup and whole milk may be increased as the child is able
to handle it, taking care, however, not to increase the
strength of the mixture too rapidly or too much, or digestional
disturbances will result.</p>


<h4 class="smcap">Buttermilk Mixture for Infants</h4>

<p class="center"><i>544.6 calories</i></p>

<p>1 tbs. wheat flour, 4 tbs. dextri-maltose, 8 oz. hot water
plus enough hot water to replace that which is lost through
evaporation (about 6 oz.). Buttermilk, sufficient quantity
to make 1 quart of mixture. Mix flour with a little cold
buttermilk. Dissolve sugar (dextri-maltose) in the hot
water.</p>

<p>Stir two mixtures together and add enough buttermilk
to make 1 quart. Place on stove and bring mixture quickly
to a boil. Boil for 20 minutes, stirring constantly, strain,
measure, and add enough boiling water to replace that
which is lost in cooking. Place on ice and use as directed.</p>

<p>The nurse will soon be able to tell how much water is
lost in evaporation and add the additional amount to the
mixture before beginning the boiling.</p>


<h4 class="smcap">Eiweissmilch<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a><br />
(Protein or Albumen Milk)</h4>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Ingredients">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">1 quart fresh whole milk</td>
    <td class="tdl">4 teaspoons essence of pepsin,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdc" colspan="2">1 pint of fresh buttermilk</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
Heat whole milk to 100&deg; F., add essence of pepsin and
stir thoroughly. Allow to stand at same temperature until
the curd is formed. Pour mass into muslin bag and drip
the whey from the curd. When the mass is as dry as it is
possible to have it, remove it from the bag to a fine strainer.
Press curd through the strainer with a wooden spoon or
potato masher (the author has found that a potato ricer
with a piece of copper gauze, such as is used in a chemical
laboratory, inserted, facilitates the breaking up of the curd).
The mass must be passed several times through the strainer
in order to make the precipitate sufficiently fine to look like
milk. During the process of straining, the buttermilk is
added. The composition of above formula is, according to
Finkelstein and Meyer, as follows:</p>

<p>Protein 3%, Fat 8.5%, Sugar 1.5%, Salts 0.5%.</p>

<p>There are several prepared Eiweissmilch mixtures on
the market, Beebe, Hoose and others. Larasan Roche is also
a prepared mixture having a composition much like that of
the original Eiweissmilch, it is easily prepared, and the
results from feeding this milk have been found generally
good.</p>

by the physician, using those from the 5% group until
otherwise ordered. These must be boiled in three separate
waters to further reduce their carbohydrate content.</p>

<p>Cream or butter is added to them when diet permits; in
the beginning (after starvation) only salt or (in case the
vegetable is given in form of a salad) a little lemon juice
with a little salt and pepper added.</p>

<p>Grated onion, a small quantity of celery seed, or a tiny
bit of chopped green pepper may be added for additional
seasoning. When some fats are allowed, butter, olive oil,
and cocoanut cream may be used; the latter is prepared as
follows:</p>

<p>1 small cocoanut grated; this is washed in cold water
slightly acidulated with vinegar to remove the sugar, then
washed to remove the vinegar. Over the washed cocoanut
pour 1 pint of boiling water; allow to stand until cold
enough to squeeze through a cloth; press as much of the
water out as possible. Pour the water into a shallow dish
and allow to stand until the cream rises; skim off and serve
with lemon juice on salad as a dressing.</p>

<p><strong>Dependence of the body upon Food.</strong>&mdash;The human
body, like any other piece of machinery, undergoes a constant
wear and tear incidental to the work it performs, but
in the human machine this is not all that must be included
in its upkeep. The replacing of the dead and cast out cells
with new ones, the repairing of the worn cells, the furnishing
of heat, not only for the running of the engine but for
the maintenance of the body temperature,&mdash;all of these
must be considered and cared for if life is to continue. In
man-made machinery, the renewal of the worn parts, and
the replacing of those no longer useful must be accomplished
by an outside agency. But in the body this work is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
performed by the organism; and the material used for the purpose,
as well as that which is used to furnish the heat necessary
for the internal and external activities of the body is food.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptions to this Rule.</strong>&mdash;Under normal conditions
the body never uses its own structure either for fuel or to
replace tissue losses. In starvation the body rebuilds its
important tissues, such as the nerves and glands, at the
expense of the less important ones, such as the connective
tissues and the skeletal muscles (Taylor).</p>

<p>Science has proved that for the most part the body does
not use the food materials in their original form, but carries
them through a series of transformations into substances
more easily handled by the organism.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, we may say that the body carries the
foodstuffs through practically four processes on the pathway
through the body, namely, digestion, absorption, metabolism,
elimination.</p>

<p><strong>Processes Included in Digestion.</strong>&mdash;There are several
processes concerned in this transformation of the food materials.
Some are purely mechanical and have to do with
the movement of the food mass through the digestive tract:
others are of a chemical character and bring about distinct
changes in the food materials themselves. These mechanical
and chemical processes with the retarding and stimulating
agents that influence them are called digestion.</p>

<p><strong>Absorption.</strong>&mdash;After the food materials have undergone
digestion, or simplification into more available substances,
these substances are absorbed, that is, they are passed
through the membranes lining the walls of the intestinal
tract, and thence to the blood.</p>

<p><strong>Metabolism.</strong>&mdash;The utilization of the transformed food
materials and their final fate in the human body is included
under the term Metabolism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
<strong>Elimination.</strong>&mdash;After the food materials have been utilized
to the extent of the body&rsquo;s ability to handle them,
their waste products are cast out of the organism by way of
the skin, the lungs, the intestines and the kidneys.</p>

<p>A brief description of these processes seems desirable
here.</p>

<p><strong>Digestion.</strong>&mdash;Mechanical digestion begins in the mouth,
where through the action of the teeth, the tongue and the
muscles of the jaw, the food material is ground up and liquefied
to a certain extent and made ready for the chemical
action which takes place, to a limited degree only, as a
result of the salivary enzyme in the mouth. The eating of
food causes a flow of saliva from the three pairs of large
salivary glands, and from the numerous secretory cells situated
in the membranes of the mouth. As a rule the food
stays for too short a time in this organ for any appreciable
amount of chemical action to take place, but the liquefaction
of the food mass with the salivary juices which contain
the ferment (ptyalin), prepares for its passage into the gastric
organ, and allows the digestion of the starch (the only
foodstuff affected by salivary digestant), to continue in that
part of the stomach until its action is checked by the hydrochloric
acid in the gastric juice.</p>

<p><strong>Arrangement of Food in the Stomach.</strong>&mdash;To simplify
the study of the gastric organs it may be well to think of
the stomach as being divided into three regions, <i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;the
fundus, the middle region, and the pyloric end,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> each of
which differs slightly from the other. After being swallowed,
the food enters the region situated at the cardiac
end, known as the fundus.</p>

<p><strong>Motor Processes in the Stomach.</strong>&mdash;There are no peristaltic
waves in the fundus of the stomach, and the movement
of the food mass is accomplished through the stretching
and contraction of the muscular walls of the organ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
which tends to churn and further mix it with the salivary
juices as it is gently pushed out into the middle region. In
this region the peristaltic waves begin and travel toward
the pylorus and increase in force as digestion progresses,
ceasing only with the emptying of the organ. When the
first stratum of food reaches the middle of the stomach it is
caught by these oscillating peristaltic waves and forced
forward through the pyloric region and against the pylorus,
from whence it is returned back through rings of constriction.
This forward and backward movement continues as
long as there is food in the stomach, thus thoroughly mixing
the mass with the gastric juice and allowing the enzymes
existing in the juices to have an opportunity for action
(chemical digestion).</p>

<p><strong>Passage of Food from Stomach.</strong>&mdash;The material prepared
in the stomach, known as <strong>chyme</strong>, is passed into the
duodenum through the pylorus. The opening of this
sphincter is controlled, according to Cannon, to a certain
extent by the liquefication of the chyme, but more especially
by the presence of free acid in the stomach side of the
pyloric orifice.</p>

<p><strong>Behavior of Food in the Intestines.</strong>&mdash;The food does
not pass at once along the canal, but waits in the duodenum
until several portions have passed through. As the food
mass is made alkaline in the presence of the intestinal juices,
the pyloric valve closes, opening again as the contents
nearest it on the stomach side are acidified.</p>

<p><strong>Intestinal Movements.</strong>&mdash;The peristaltic waves in the
small intestines begin in the upper part and start a course
ever downward. These waves in the intestines are two-fold
in character; the quick shallow wave which forces the
food string forward, breaking it up into segments, and backward
joining the segments together again, and the strong
deep wave which carries the entire mass forward after each
segmentation. This method of movement in the small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
intestines is the best one possible under the conditions which
prevail in this region of the digestional apparatus, since it
not only mixes the food material with the juices necessary
for its digestion, but likewise spreads it out over a wide
space, insuring a greater contact with the absorbing walls of
the small intestines.</p>

<p><strong>The Effect of Muscular Constrictions.</strong>&mdash;The muscular
constrictions occurring in the intestines producing segmentation
of the food string have, according to Sherman, the
effect of &ldquo;(1) further mixing of the food and digestive
juices, (2) bringing the digested food into contact with the
absorbing membrane, (3) emptying the venous and lymphatic
radicles in the membrane, the material which they
have absorbed being forced into the veins and lymph vessels
by the compression of the intestinal walls.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><strong>Movements in the Large Intestine.</strong>&mdash;The movements
in the large intestine or colon are much like those in other
parts of the digestive tract. The small and large intestine
are divided by a valve known as the ileocecal valve, and
any food which passes through it cannot return, since the
valve is a competent one. The cells in the walls of the
larger intestine secrete fluids of a lubricating character,
containing no enzymes of digestion but aiding in moving the
fecal matter toward the rectum.</p>

<p><strong>Distribution of Secretory Cells.</strong>&mdash;Secretory cells are
distributed in each of the three regions of the stomach, but
are more numerous in the middle region than at either end.
The third region includes the pyloric vestibule through
which all foods must pass before they can enter the small
intestine, and terminates in the pylorus, the valve which
shuts off the stomach from the duodenum and the rest of
the intestinal canal.</p>

<p><strong>Chemical Digestion.</strong>&mdash;The chemical changes in the
food materials, after they are eaten, are brought about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
through the action of certain substances known as soluble
ferments or &ldquo;enzymes.&rdquo; These enzymes exist in every tissue
of the body, and their province is first to break down
the food materials themselves into simpler compounds, and
then to reconstruct the simpler substances into those of a
more complex character, which are more available for the
various uses of the organism.</p>

<p><strong>Action of the Enzymes.</strong>&mdash;As Sherman has stated, &ldquo;all
fermentation is brought about either directly or indirectly
by the activity of animal or vegetable organisms or cells.
When the organisms or cells act directly and the chemical
changes occur only in their presence, the fermentation is said
to be due to an organized ferment. When the action is not
brought about directly by the cell itself, but by means of a
substance secreted by the cell but acting apart from it, this
substance is called a soluble or unorganized ferment or
&lsquo;enzyme.&rsquo;&rdquo; The enzymes concerned in digestion and
metabolism, their source and their action, may be found in
the following table:</p>

<strong>Classification of Enzymes.</strong>&mdash;Sherman classifies the
enzymes of the body according to their effects:</p>

<p>1. The hydrolytic enzymes:</p>

<p class="lists">
(<i>a</i>) Proteolytic or protein-splitting enzymes.<br />
(<i>b</i>) Lipolytic or fat-splitting enzymes.<br />
(<i>c</i>) Amylolytic or starch-splitting enzymes.<br />
(<i>d</i>) Sugar-splitting enzymes.<br />
</p>

<p>2. The coagulating enzymes, such as thrombin or thrombase
(the fibrin ferment) and rennin, which causes the
clotting of milk.</p>

<p>3. The oxidizing enzymes or oxidases (which, if the oxidation
be accompanied by a splitting off of amino groups,
may be called &ldquo;deaminizing&rdquo; enzymes).</p>

<p>4. The reducing enzymes or &ldquo;reductases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>5. Those which produce carbon dioxide without the use
of free &ldquo;deamidizing&rdquo; oxygen, such as zymase of yeast.</p>

<p>6. Enzymes causing the breaking down of a larger into
a smaller molecule of the same composition, as in the production
of lactic acid from glucose.</p>


<h3>DIGESTION (CHEMICAL)</h3>

<p><strong>Salivary Digestion.</strong>&mdash;The table shows that enzymic
action begins in the mouth. <strong>Saliva</strong>, the characteristic secretion
of this region, contains the enzyme ptyalin which
exerts its influence upon the starches and dextrins. The
food mass remains in the mouth for so short a time, however,
that a very small percentage of the starch is changed
to maltose under salivary digestion. The action of ptyalin,
however, continues in the fundus of the stomach until
stopped by the acid in the gastric juice.</p>

<p><strong>Gastric Digestion.</strong>&mdash;The conditions existing in this
region of the gastric organ of digestion are particularly
favorable to the continuance of salivary digestion on account
of the neutral character of the juices secreted by the
cells there, and because there is so little movement taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
place. The cells in the middle region, however, secrete a
fluid rich in acid, and as the food mass is gradually pushed
forward by the contraction of the stomach walls into this
portion of the stomach, further conversion of starch and
dextrin to maltose is checked. Gastric juice is secreted by
cells situated in all parts of the stomach. The character of
the secretions differs in different parts of the organ. However,
that in the fundus is neutral in character or even
slightly alkaline, according to Howell, while that in the
middle region is highly acid. The pyloric end of the
stomach exhibits strong peptonizing powers and much of
the hydrolysis of protein takes place here. As the food is
pushed out of the fundus it is caught by the waves of
peristaltic action and swept toward the pylorus. This movement
of the food mass to and from the pylorus under the
influence of the muscular constriction in the stomach tends
to mix it thoroughly with the juices in all parts of the
stomach, and in a measure to liquefy it to the &ldquo;souplike&rdquo;
mixture known as chyme.</p>

<p><strong>Rate of Carbohydrates, Proteins, and Fats.</strong>&mdash;Carbohydrates,
for example, do not require any acid for their
digestion, hence all of the acid with which they come in
contact can go toward acidifying them, while the proteins
require hydrochloric acid before the enzymes can begin to
exert their activities. Consequently they leave the stomach
much more slowly than the carbohydrates. The fats leave
more slowly than any of the other food combinations. If
carbohydrates and proteins are taken together they leave
the stomach more slowly than if the carbohydrates were
fed alone, but more quickly than they would if the meal
consisted of protein alone. When the meal consists of fats
and proteins, the stomach is emptied more slowly than is
the case when either is fed alone.</p>

<p><strong>Intestinal Digestion.</strong>&mdash;Digestion proceeds in an orderly
manner throughout the intestinal canal. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
pancreatic juice, bile, and intestinal juice are poured upon the
food mass on its entrance into the duodenum. The enzymes
work simultaneously. <em>Trypsin</em> in the pancreatic juice
takes up the hydrolysis of the proteoses and peptones and
those proteins which have escaped gastric digestion. The
<em>amylopsin</em> likewise in the pancreatic secretion acts upon the
starch and dextrin, changing them to maltose. The lipases
split the fats to fatty acids and glycerol.</p>

<p>The <em>erepsin</em> in the intestinal juice, &ldquo;succus entericus,&rdquo;
brings about further change in the proteins, with the production
of amino acids. The bulk of the carbohydrates are
converted into monosaccharids in the small intestines.
The lactose, maltose, and sucrose are changed through the
activity of the lactase, maltase, and invertase into glucose.
Sherman states that &ldquo;it is possible that the splitting of the
lactose (milk sugar) may occur in the intestinal wall rather
than in the food mass.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><strong>Bile.</strong>&mdash;Human bile, the secretion most actively concerned
in the digestion and absorption of the fats, contains
water, bile salts, bile acids, bile pigments, cholesterin, lecithin,
and a peculiar protein derived from the mucous membranes
of the bile ducts and gall bladder.</p>

<p><strong>Stimulation of Intestinal Secretions.</strong>&mdash;The flow of the
intestinal juices is stimulated by a substance or <em>hormone</em>
known as &ldquo;<strong>secretin</strong>.&rdquo; This hormone is the result of the
action of hydrochloric acid upon some substance in the intestinal
wall. Starling claims that the formation of hormones
and their circulation through the blood to the reactive
tissues is sufficient to account for the activity of the pancreas;
he doubts if the nervous system plays any part in
the activity of that organ.</p>

<p><strong>Secretion of Water in the Stomach.</strong>&mdash;The secretion of
water by the cells of the stomach is such, according to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
Taylor, as to produce chyme of quite constant consistency, the
solid particles being held in suspension in the fluid medium.</p>

<p><strong>Factors Influencing Gastric Digestion.</strong>&mdash;The factors
influencing digestion in the stomach constitute all those
mechanical, electrical, chemical, and psychical factors which
stimulate or retard the action of the gastric juices. The
movements in the stomach are involuntary, but their activities
may be stimulated by the flow of gastric juice. Sleep
retards digestion in the stomach by retarding the movements
in the organ itself.</p>

<p><strong>Stimuli to Gastric Flow.</strong>&mdash;The division and liquefaction
of the food in the mouth hastens gastric digestion by
making the food better fitted for the action of the enzymes
in the gastric juice. The type as well as the character of
the food acts as a stimulus to the gastric secretion.</p>

<p><strong>Water</strong> is probably the best of all the agents for stimulating
the secretion of gastric juice, while <strong>dextrin</strong> (toast, zwieback)
and the <strong>extractives of meat</strong> likewise exert similar
powers.</p>

<p><strong>Retarding the Gastric Flow.</strong>&mdash;The nervous system, on
the other hand, at times checks or entirely inhibits a flow
of these juices. Worry, excitement, anger, fatigue, chill;
each plays its part in promoting poor digestion in the
gastric organ. As chemical factors, water and salts are the
two necessary substances for gastric digestion, since the
enzymes in the juices cannot act except in their presence.</p>

<p><strong>Alkaline carbonates</strong> and <strong>fatty foods</strong> both check the
flow of gastric juice, and retard digestion. The psychic
factors which result in a stimulation of the secretory cells
in the stomach are exerted through the sight, smell, and
taste. One often hears the expression: &ldquo;The food looked,
smelled, or tasted so good that it made my mouth water.&rdquo;
This actually occurs; hence the secretion has been named
appetite juice. This appetite juice acts as a direct stimulant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
to the cells in the mucous lining of the stomach, causing a
flow of gastric juice. It cannot be said to cause digestion,
but it certainly institutes that process, thus starting the
whole digestional procedure.</p>

<p><strong>Digestion in the Larger Intestine.</strong>&mdash;Science has
proved that most of the nourishing part of the food ingested
is digested and absorbed before it reaches the larger intestine.
The two portions of the alimentary canal known as
the small and large intestine are separated by the ileocecal
valve. Cannon claims &ldquo;that this valve is competent, that is,
under normal conditions the food mass which passes through
into the colon cannot be forced back into the small intestine.&rdquo;
The food mass sometimes contains materials which
have escaped digestion, likewise some of the active enzymes
which bring about their hydrolysis, in which case a certain
amount of their digestion may continue in the large intestine.</p>

<p>So far, investigators have found no enzymes in the
fluids secreted by the cells in the walls of the large intestine,
but they have found an alkaline fluid which assists in completing
the digestion of the foods which has started in other
parts of the intestinal tract.</p>

<p><strong>Absorption.</strong>&mdash;Absorption of food occurs in all parts of
the intestinal canal, but the major portion of it occurs in
the small intestines, the mucous membrane lining of which
seems particularly adapted for this purpose. According to
Taylor there is no absorption of fats, carbohydrates, or proteins
in the stomach. Other investigators believe that some
of the protein is absorbed and also some glucose in concentrated
solution. However, the stomach cannot be considered
of great value as an absorbing organ. Physiology
teaches that the absorption of the products of digestion
occurs by means of the millions of small projections or villi
with which the intestinal wall is lined. These villi contain
numerous capillary blood vessels and spaces known as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
lacteals. The former converge into the portal vein, the latter
into the lymphatic vessels and thence into the thoracic ducts.</p>

<p><strong>The Absorption of Fat.</strong>&mdash;The fats, as has been described,
are split into their two constituents, fatty acid and
glycerol. The former is dissolved by the bile to form soap;
the latter is readily soluble in water. These constituents
thus dissolved pass through the walls and recombine in the
form of neutral fat droplets, probably during the passage
through the walls, since they appear in this form in the
cells. They pass into the thoracic duct and thence into the
blood stream.</p>

<p><strong>Absorption of Carbohydrates.</strong>&mdash;The carbohydrates are
chiefly absorbed in the form of monosaccharids. This has
been proved by introducing cane sugar or lactose into the
blood vessels and getting the greater portion of it back unchanged
by way of the urine. As the monosaccharids are
taken up by the capillaries lining the walls of the small
intestines, they are passed on to the portal vein and carried
by the portal blood into the liver, where they are stored
temporarily as glycogen, and given out to the blood in the
form of glucose as needed. After a meal rich in carbohydrates,
the portal blood will be rich in glucose, while the
blood in general circulation contains about the same amount
as usual, about 0.1%.</p>

<p><strong>Absorption of Proteins.</strong>&mdash;The absorption of the products
of protein digestion occurs through the capillary blood
vessels and passes on to the portal vein. The metabolism of
protein is more complex than that of any of the foodstuffs.
It is probable that each living cell contains enzymes
which are capable of breaking down the body proteins with
the production of amino acids just as the proteins of the
food are broken down by enzymes of digestion, and according
to Sherman &ldquo;it is not improbable that protein synthesis
also may be brought about by every living cell.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Absorption of Water.</strong>&mdash;This does not occur in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
the stomach, as was formerly believed, but in the small
intestines.</p>

<p><strong>The Absorption of the Mineral Salts.</strong>&mdash;This occurs in
conjunction with the other food material. Some of the mineral
salts are much more soluble than others and are more
readily absorbed. The function of the mineral salts in the
body has already been described, and since they form a part
of every tissue and fluid in the body their absorption and
fate in metabolism must be studied with that of the other
chemical combinations.</p>


<h3>ABSORPTION IN THE LARGE INTESTINES</h3>

<p>The digestion of the food as it is passed into the last
portion of the alimentary canal has been largely completed.
However, that part which has escaped digestion in the
small intestine is finished and absorbed here. The important
peristaltic waves occurring in this region are antiperistaltic
in character and have the property of churning
the food thoroughly and bringing a larger portion of it in
contact with the absorbing walls. The water which is left
in the food mass together with the products of the digestion
of the foodstuffs is absorbed in the first part of the large
intestine, leaving the remainder more solid. This residue
is known as feces or fecal matter.</p>

<p>The diagram on page <a href="#diagram">179</a> shows the various processes
through which the foodstuffs pass after absorption.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><strong>Bacterial Action in the Alimentary Canal.</strong>&mdash;The
changes in the foods so far mentioned have been chiefly the
result of the activity of the enzymes existing in the various
digestive processes throughout the body. But there are
other changes which occur in the foods during their sojourn
in the digestive tract which are not accountable to enzymic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
action, but which, in fact, modify to a certain degree the
changes wrought by the enzymes. These are the result of
the activity of certain specific bacteria which inhabit the
entire digestive tract of the individual from a few hours
after birth until death. Some of these have so adapted
themselves to the existing conditions that, unless present
in overwhelming numbers, they are not only harmless, but
they actually assist in protecting the organism from the
inroads of more harmful species. Many experiments have
been made to find whether or not bacteria are essential to
human nutrition, and the results of these experiments prove
that they are not. However, since they are so firmly established
in the body it is well to study the various types and
learn as much as possible of the products of their activity
and the influence which they exert in human nutrition.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Bacteria.</strong>&mdash;It would be impossible and unnecessary
to consider the action of all of the bacteria in the
body in this text, but it is necessary to consider those which
are prominent in bringing about decomposition of the foods
in the digestive tract. Sherman holds that there are three
main types having this property: &ldquo;(1) the bacteria of fermentation,
such, for example, as the lactic acid bacteria;
(2) the putrefactive bacteria, such as the ana&euml;robic B.
a&euml;rogenes capsulatus; (3) bacteria of the B. coli type, showing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
the character of both the fermentative and putrefactive
organisms but tending in general to antagonize the putrefactive
ana&euml;robes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p><strong>Fermentation in the Stomach.</strong>&mdash;In the stomach, fermentation
of the carbohydrates with the production of
organic acids, and at times alcohol, occurs. The types of
fermentation taking place in the stomach are alcoholic,
lactic, butyric, acetic, formic, oxalic, and cellulose. The
bacteria inhabiting the gastric organs are dependent upon
air for existence, while those in the intestines are not.</p>

<p><strong>Factors Influencing Excessive Fermentation.</strong>&mdash;The
factors influencing excessive fermentation in the stomach
are lack of &ldquo;tone&rdquo; and motility in the organ, insufficient
amount or absence of free hydrochloric acid in the gastric
secretion, dilatation of the stomach, and an excess of carbohydrate
foods in the diet. Of the latter, sucrose and glucose
are especially susceptible to the action of fermentative bacteria.
Under normal conditions, that is, in health, the conditions
prevailing in the stomach are very unfavorable to
the development of bacteria of the putrefactive type, the
gastric juice exhibiting decided germicidal properties.
Then, too, the presence of air acts against their development.
Much of the so-called gastric fermentation does not
occur in the stomach but rather in the duodenum.</p>

<p><strong>Bacterial Action in the Intestines.</strong>&mdash;In the lower part
of the small and in the large intestines, the bacteria of the
ana&euml;robic type increase, conditions more favorable to their
development existing there than farther up in the intestinal
tract. However, there are a great many bacteria in
the whole of the small intestine. Those producing decomposition
of the unabsorbed proteins are especially prominent
in the colon.</p>

<p>Herter<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> states that &ldquo;the presence in the colon of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
immense numbers of obligate micro-organisms of the B.
coli type may be an important defense of the organism in
the sense that they hinder the development of that putrefactive
decomposition which, if prolonged, is so injurious
to the organism as a whole. We have in this adaptation the
most rational explanation of the meaning of the myriads
of colon bacilli that inhabit the large intestine. This view
is not inconsistent with the conception that under some conditions
the colon bacilli multiply to such an extent as to
prove harmful through the part they take in promoting fermentation
and putrefaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Effect of Bacterial Activity in the Body.</strong>&mdash;In summarizing
the effects of bacterial action in the body it is
found that with the exception of oxalic acid, which is exceedingly
injurious, and which, according to Herter, results
from the eating of large quantities of meat and sugar, the
products of fermentation are simply irritating in character,
while those resulting from putrefaction are distinctly toxic.
Among the substances deserving mention under this head
we have indol, skatol, cresol, and phenol. These substances
are very soluble and upon absorption combine with
the sulphuric acid formed in the body and are excreted by
way of the kidneys where they appear in the urine as &ldquo;conjugated
sulphates,&rdquo; the chief of which is indican. The
amount of indican in the urine is taken as a measure of the
intensity of the putrefaction taking place in the body.</p>

<p><strong>Metabolism.</strong>&mdash;Under the term metabolism we understand
the series of processes through the foodstuffs and
carried (<i>a</i>) in the conservation of the tissues of the body
and (<i>b</i>) in the maintenance of body temperature and physical
work (Taylor). The processes concerned in metabolism
are chiefly those of building up, &ldquo;anabolism,&rdquo; and
breaking down, &ldquo;catabolism.&rdquo; In the processes of anabolism
the products absorbed are built into the tissues and cells of
the body. In catabolism, the worn particles from the cells,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
and the dead cells no longer useful are broken up and
thrown out of the body. According to Taylor, &ldquo;side by side
with these processes are the reactions of combustion,
whereby the temperature necessary for the life of the cells
is maintained, and the energy needed for external work
furnished.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Behavior of Carbohydrates in Metabolism.</strong>&mdash;As Sherman<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
has said: &ldquo;At least two kinds of enzymes are believed
to be involved in the combustion of glucose in the tissue
cells, (1) cleavage enzymes, which split the molecule into
fragments more easily oxidized, and (2) oxidizing enzymes
or oxidases which stimulate the oxidation of the cleavage
products. Both kinds of enzymes are widely distributed
through the body and are believed to be normal constituents
of all active cells.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Production of Energy.</strong>&mdash;It has been proved that the
energy for external and internal work is produced largely
from the glucose brought by the blood and oxidized in the
muscles.</p>

<p>When a surplus amount of carbohydrate food is eaten,
over and above the immediate needs of the body for fuel,
it is stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen, which can
be readily reconverted into glucose. When the supply of
carbohydrate food is greatly in excess of the body&rsquo;s needs,
that is when the liver and muscles cease to store glycogen,
it is built up into adipose tissue and furnishes a readily
available source of emergency fuel.</p>

<p><strong>Fate of the Carbohydrates.</strong>&mdash;After their oxidation the
end products of carbohydrates, that is, the substances which
are no longer available for use in the body, leave it in the
form of carbon dioxide and water by way of the kidneys
(urine), the skin, the lungs, and the intestines.</p>

<p><strong>Fate of the Fats.</strong>&mdash;The fats upon absorption are taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
up by the lymph vessels instead of the capillaries and enter
the blood with the lymph. According to various investigators,
the fat which causes the turbidity of the blood
plasma at the height of absorption will, as a rule, disappear
after a few hours, part of it being burned as fuel, producing
energy for the internal and external work of the body, and
at least a part of the fats eaten being rebuilt into body fat.
The end-products of fat metabolism, like those of the carbohydrates,
consist of carbon dioxide and water, and leave the
body by the same excretory channels.</p>

<p>When the normal oxidation of the fatty acids is interfered
with or is overtaxed, a different reaction from that
which usually occurs may take place, and this results in
an excretion of acetone in the urine (see Chapter on <a href="#chap20">Diabetes</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Protein metabolism</strong> is certainly more complex than that
of either of the other active organic food groups. The
amino acids which are the products of protein digestion are
taken up by the capillary blood vessels in the intestinal
walls and are passed by them into the portal vein, soon to
become available for the needs of the body.</p>

<p><strong>Fate of the Proteins.</strong>&mdash;After utilization in the body,
the proteins, like the other foods, leave certain waste products
which indicate to a greater or lesser extent the completeness
with which the organism has made use of the food
materials. The end-products of protein metabolism are:
<strong>urea</strong>, <strong>ammonium salts</strong>, <strong>purin bodies</strong>, and <strong>creatinin</strong>. These
products leave the body chiefly in the urine. The chief end-product
in man is urea. This substance represents from
82-88% of the total nitrogen excreted by the kidneys.
However, the less highly oxidized products represent the
incomplete products of protein metabolism and thus indicate
the changes through which these products must pass
before being changed into urea. If for any reason there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
an impairment of the liver through which they must pass
and where the change into urea is accomplished, there will
be a rise of ammonia and a corresponding decrease in the
output of urea in the urine. Thus, ammonia is formed at
the expense of the urea. This occurs in fevers, diabetes, and
certain structural diseases of the liver. According to Sherman:<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
&ldquo;Normally about 2 to 6% of the total nitrogen
eliminated is in the form of ammonium salts, the amount
depending largely upon the relation between the acid-forming
and base-forming elements in the food.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Acid-forming and Base-forming Foods.</strong>&mdash;Mendel<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
states: &ldquo;There are foods which act as potential acids and
others which function as bases in the organism. When
burned up either in the laboratory or in the body cells, they
have a preponderance of acid or base, as the case may be,
in their ash.&rdquo; In this respect potatoes, apples, raisins, and
cantaloupes, for example, are base-forming foods which
depress the output of ammonia and increase the solubility
of uric acid in the urine, whereas meal, cereals, and prunes
(the latter with their content of benzoic acid) furnish acids
in predominance.</p>

<p><strong>Purin Bases.</strong>&mdash;These compounds are formed in the
body as cleavage products of nucleoproteins or taken into
the body in food. The chief of these products are <strong>adenin</strong>,
<strong>guanin</strong>, <strong>hypoxanthin</strong>, <strong>xanthin</strong>, and <strong>uric acid</strong>. The latter
is the most highly oxidized of all the purin bases and is the
form in which they are chiefly eliminated in the urine.</p>

<p><strong>Formation of Uric Acid.</strong>&mdash;The formation of uric acid
can in a measure be controlled by attention to the diet,
eliminating those foods known to be purin-bearing. Normally
from 1 to 3% of the nitrogen eliminated will be
in the form of uric acid. The normal human being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
oxidizes about half of the purins eaten and excretes about
half, mainly in the form of uric acid. According to Mendel,
the formation of uric acid takes place throughout the body,
and its partial destruction is accomplished by the kidneys,
muscles, and liver. The formation of purins in the body
and their elimination in the form of uric acid is especially
significant in certain pathological conditions, gout, for
example, in which the body has difficulty in eliminating
these compounds.</p>

<p>The purin bodies are both endogenous and exogenous&mdash;that
is, they may be brought into the body in food as such,
or they may be formed as a result of the metabolism of the
body tissues. For this reason the damage wrought by these
substances may to a certain extent be controlled by eliminating
the purin-bearing foods from the diet. Flesh-foods are
high in purins, especially the highly nucleated glandular
organs, liver, thymus (sweetbreads), etc., kidney, beef, mutton,
veal, pork, chicken, turkey, goose, sardines, anchovies,
all kinds of fish except cod. Among the vegetable foods
asparagus, beans, peas, and spinach are highest in purins.
Boiling extracts much of the purins from food. Meat especially
should be prepared by this method, if used in the
diet of individuals suffering from gout. Eggs and milk are
purin free, and may be used freely. Certain substances increase
the difficulty of eliminating uric acid. Alcoholic
beverages for example are especially deleterious.</p>

<p><strong>Creatinin.</strong>&mdash;This end-product of protein metabolism is,
like uric acid, endogenous and exogenous. It is one of the
normal constituents of the urine. The quantity is fairly
constant for the individual, averaging about 0.02 gram per
kilogram of body weight per day.</p>

<p><strong>Mineral Metabolism.</strong>&mdash;A study of the organic foodstuffs
reveals the fact that many of the mineral salts concerned
in nutrition enter the body in organic combination
with those constituents. Certain of the mineral salts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
however, enter, exist in and leave the body in the same organic
form in which they occur in the food materials. This is
true of chlorine, which for the most part, functions in and
leaves the body in the form of chlorides (chiefly sodium
chloride). A small part of the chlorine is used in the production
of the hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice.</p>

<p>Sulphur and iron, both enter the body as essential constituents
of proteins, and their metabolism occurs with
that of these foodstuffs; the sulphur being converted largely
into sulphuric acid must be neutralized at once, and it leaves
the body by way of the urine as inorganic sulphates. Part
of the sulphates are excreted as ethereal (conjugated)
sulphates; the amount excreted in this form depending
largely upon the extent of purification in the intestinal
tract.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p><strong>Phosphorus.</strong>&mdash;This mineral salt is found to be present
as an essential constituent of certain proteins, fats and
carbohydrates. It also enters the body in the form of inorganic
phosphates. During the digestion and metabolism of
the organic foodstuffs the phosphoric acid radical is split off
and eventually nearly all of the phosphorus leaves the body
in inorganic form (inorganic phosphates).</p>

<p><strong>Calcium.</strong>&mdash;Being the chief constituent of the bones,
large quantities of calcium salts are stored in the skeleton
of the child both before and after birth. The functions of
calcium have already been discussed. That part not stored,
which has finished its work in the body is excreted through
the intestinal wall and leaves the body by way of the feces,
only a small part of the calcium concerned in metabolism
being excreted in the urine.</p>

<p><strong>The Process of Osmosis in the Body.</strong>&mdash;The influence
exerted upon the process of osmosis in the body is one of
the most important parts played by the mineral salts in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
metabolism. The fact that these chemical substances are
indispensable to the metabolic processes makes it necessary
for the nurse to know where they can be found in food
and how best to use them.</p>

<p><strong>Metabolism of Body Tissues.</strong>&mdash;The constant breaking
down and building up of the tissues of the body and the
evolution of heat as a by-product of the energy expended
may be summed up in the term &ldquo;metabolism.&rdquo; The metabolism
of the body is normally supported by the food
ingested. However, it is a known fact that were no food
eaten the processes would continue just the same, the difference
only being the use of the body structure instead of
food materials. According to Sherman, the chemical
changes and energy transformations are of course inseparable.
It has become customary to speak of the metabolism
of matter and the metabolism of energy, and to regard
the extent of the metabolism of any material substance as
measured by the amount of its end products eliminated, and
the extent of the energy metabolism as measured by the
amount of heat or of heat and external muscular work which
the body gives off.</p>


<p class="hrpad">In summarizing the important factors in the utilization
of food by the body several distinct points are made evident:</p>

<p>1. The composition of the body, and the composition of
food, are practically the same.</p>

<p>2. Food must make good the losses resulting from metabolic
processes and physical activity.</p>

<p>3. Utilization of food by the body necessitates:</p>

<h2><a name="chap08" id="chap08"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<br />
PREGNANCY AND LACTATION</h2>


<p>There are many traditions in regard to the food requirements
of the prospective mother. Many of these have been
proved fallacies. As a matter of fact it is the woman more
than the developing child who is likely to suffer if the diet
is insufficient or badly balanced.</p>

<p><strong>Factors Affecting Diet during Pregnancy.</strong>&mdash;In formulating
a dietary for the pregnant woman, then, not only
must the needs of the child be considered but those of the
mother also, since the developing embryo draws from the
body of the woman materials necessary for its growth, and
if these needs are not covered by an increase in the diet,
her body and that of the child also will show evidences of
lack of nourishment.</p>

<p><strong>Phosphorus and Calcium Requirements.</strong>&mdash;If, for example,
the mother&rsquo;s diet is lacking in those materials which
produce growth, or is deficient in those mineral salts, such
as those of phosphorus and calcium, which are requisite and
necessary for the growth of bones in the infant, the mother&rsquo;s
bones and teeth will show this loss and in all probability
the baby will sooner or later also show a like deficiency.
However, it must be remembered that the pregnant woman
is under a strain, both physical and mental. She must not
be encouraged to eat beyond her needs or the digestion will
be disturbed.</p>

<p><strong>Nutritional Disturbances in Early Months.</strong>&mdash;The nutritional
disturbance manifested by nausea and vomiting in
the morning is due, not to the stomach or any disturbance
therein, but to the fact that a mild form of poisoning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
occurs, resulting from the substances produced through the
formation of the placenta reaching the general circulation
on account of the incomplete establishment of the connection
between the embryo and the mother. As soon as this
connection is complete and fetal circulation is established
this &ldquo;morning sickness&rdquo; disappears.</p>

<p><strong>Food Requirements of Prospective Mother.</strong>&mdash;The
food requirements of the prospective mother are not materially
affected during the first four months of gestation,
and even after this, when the infant is developing rapidly,
and up to the date of its birth, the mother&rsquo;s requirements
are only increased about 20%. The amount of food necessary
to cover the body needs, for maintenance and energy
of a woman living a sedentary or moderately active life,
plus 20% for building materials for the growing child, will
be adequate for the pregnant woman. Thus, if her needs
are ordinarily from 2,000 to 2,400 calories per day, after
the fourth month they will probably be increased to 2,400
or 2,800 calories a day and will rarely ever be more than
3,000 calories a day.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment of Normal Pregnancy.</strong>&mdash;The peculiar
conditions surrounding the woman at this particular
time must be taken into consideration in arranging her diet.
The building foods which are necessary for the developing
child must be given in the simplest form, milk and eggs
being used liberally and meat sparingly to obviate any
unnecessary tax being placed upon the kidneys. The use
of fruit and green vegetables to supplement the milk and
eggs is urged. It has been found advisable at such times
to give small meals frequently rather than the regular meal
three times a day. The feeling of &ldquo;fullness&rdquo; which often
occurs during the last two or three months of gestation
makes it more comfortable for the pregnant woman to
eat less at a time and oftener. If, for example, she be
given a glass of rich milk or a nutrient beverage, either of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
enforced malted milk, albumenized orange juice, buttermilk,
zoolak, or koumiss, at about eleven o&rsquo;clock in the
morning and again about four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, she
will have taken sufficient nourishment to meet the new
requirements without taxing her digestion or imposing extra
work upon the kidneys.</p>

<p><strong>Abnormal Symptoms.</strong>&mdash;The chief point to keep in
mind is any abnormal symptom which may develop. The
chief of these is albumen in the urine. The urine must be
examined frequently and measures taken immediately to
overcome albuminuria should it occur. It is wise, as has
already been stated, to restrict the meat in the diet, and in
cases where albumen is found in the urine even when the
meats are restricted, it may be necessary to place the patient
upon a milk diet for a time until the urine clears up.</p>

<p><strong>Supplementary Feeding.</strong>&mdash;Cereals, especially the whole
cereals, must be used liberally. Gruels made with milk are
often found valuable additions to the dietary. The prospective
mother must be urged to take a regular amount of
gentle exercise, not to become over-tired, or excited, to eat
sparingly at night, and to drink plenty of water. She must
avoid becoming constipated by eating plenty of green vegetables
and fruit.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Diet Sheets.</strong>&mdash;The following dietary is suggested:
Breakfast should consist of thoroughly cooked
cereals, wheatena, cream of wheat, malt breakfast food,
cracked wheat, rolled or cracked oats, served with cream
or sugar or both, whole wheat bread, muffins, or biscuits,
with butter, raw or stewed fruit, coffee, tea or cocoa with
milk. Luncheon may consist of milk or vegetable soups,
eggs in any form, boiled potatoes, sweet potatoes, string
beans, greens, or any green vegetables, simple desserts such
as custards, rice or tapioca puddings, bread pudding, etc.,
milk, tea, cocoa, buttermilk, zoolak or koumiss as beverages.
For dinner, if albuminuria is not present, a small piece of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
meat may be taken, together with green vegetables, rice,
potatoes, simple salads, and a simple dessert, milk or coffee
with milk as a beverage.</p>

<p><strong>Selection of Food.</strong>&mdash;The following foods may be used
to formulate the diet sheet: Wheat, oat, or corn cereals,
rice, tapioca, made into simple puddings or served as breakfast
foods; fruits, oranges, prunes, apples, raisins, dates,
figs, or grapefruit, stewed or raw. The fruit juices may be
used instead of the whole fruit if the latter disagrees. Vegetables:
peas (green or dried), beans (string beans or dried
beans), spinach, greens (turnip, mustard, or beet), cabbage,
onions, celery, lettuce, served as vegetables or in soups,
potatoes. Meat: lightly broiled beefsteak or stewed or
boiled meat or chicken served not more than once a day or
three times a week. Eggs, prepared in different ways.
Cheese dishes. Breakfast bacon or ham in moderate quantities,
butter, olive oil (or other salad oils) in moderation,
whole wheat, graham or bran bread, Boston brown bread
and crackers, milk, cocoa, chocolate, buttermilk, malted
milk, koumiss, or zoolak; coffee and tea in moderation.</p>

<p>The diet, as has already been stated, may be supplemented
by nutrient beverages or milk gruels.</p>


<h3>DIET IN LACTATION</h3>

<p>The diet of the nursing mother, as has been explained
in a previous chapter, must not only cover her own requirements
but must likewise be adequate to furnish the extra
requirements imposed by the nursing infant.</p>

<p><strong>Food Requirements of Nursing Infant.</strong>&mdash;When the
baby is a month old he should be growing rapidly, and his
food requirements at this period and until he is about three
months old will be approximately fifty calories per pound
of body weight in the twenty-four hours. As he grows older
his requirements grow gradually less in proportion to his
weight. This is because the rate of growth is less, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
for the next three months the requirements are from 43 to
40 calories per pound of body weight per day, and 35
calories per pound during the last three months, or by the
end of the first year of life.</p>

<p>It has been estimated, as before stated, that the average
infant will take 2&#8531; to 2&frac12; ounces of mother&rsquo;s milk per
day<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> to each pound of body weight and that every ounce
of mother&rsquo;s milk will yield on an average 20 calories. Hence
a month-old baby weighing ten pounds will be taking about
23 ounces a day, yielding 460 calories. Scientists have estimated
that for every calorie produced by the milk two
extra calories must be provided by food, so that for the
baby requiring 460 calories per day, to cover his requirements
the mother will be obliged to consume extra food to
yield 920 calories, or the regular amount to meet her normal
requirements plus the extra food to make sufficient food
for the baby.</p>

<p><strong>Diet of Nursing Mother.</strong>&mdash;The diet of the nursing
mother need not be different from that to which she is
accustomed. She should be warned against overwork or
over-fatigue, nervous excitement and worry, since these
factors affect the digestion of the nursing baby. She must
be careful not to eat indigestible foods or foods which
disagree with her, as such things will undoubtedly affect
the digestion of the infant. When an article of food does
cause digestional disturbances in the baby, it should be
carefully omitted from the mother&rsquo;s diet.</p>

<p><strong>Factors Retarding and Stimulating Milk Secretion.</strong>&mdash;Constipation
in the mother reacts quickly and unfavorably
upon the secretion of milk. The same has proved to be the
case when she becomes excited, nervous, worried, or over-tired.</p>

<p>The average diet for the normal woman is safe for the
nursing mother. If her supply of milk is deficient, it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
be at times increased or stimulated by the drinking of a
glass of milk between meals or by taking a cup of hot
cereal milk gruel. It was formerly believed that beer, ale,
or stout acted directly upon the mammary glands, stimulating
the secretion of milk, but there is little proof of this
and the drinking of alcoholic beverages need not be encouraged
on this account, since often more nourishing beverages
fulfill the purpose more efficiently and without bad
results.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p><strong>Gastric Disturbances.</strong>&mdash;The nausea and vomiting so
often a part of early pregnancy is not believed to be the
result of a disordered stomach but primarily a mild form of
poisoning resulting from the incomplete establishment of
the fetal circulation.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusting the Diet.</strong>&mdash;The adjustment of the diet to
cover the needs of the prospective mother and those of the
developing child is essential. The amount of food taken
by the mother is not materially changed during the first
three months of gestation. An average normal diet is all
that is necessary. After this time a twenty per cent. increase
in the woman&rsquo;s diet will furnish adequate means both for
her maintenance and for the growth and development of
the child.</p>

<p><strong>Type of Food.</strong>&mdash;The kind of food which is necessary
for the pregnant woman to take during this period is very
similar to that taken ordinarily. It is necessary to furnish
food materials rich in calcium and phosphorus, with an
adequate supply of proteins in their simplest form in order
to meet the requirement of the growing organism. Milk
and eggs furnish the most efficient foods in this respect and
the prospective mother should see that they form the chief
items of her daily dietary. Milk furnishes calcium in its
most available form for the developing skeleton of the growing
infant, hence it is necessary to provide the mother with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
food to replace the mineral which is withdrawn from her
body.</p>

<p><strong>Meat in the Diet.</strong>&mdash;Meat should be eaten sparingly by
the prospective mother, as it imposes needless work upon
the already taxed kidneys and, if eaten in excess, will give
rise to dangerous complications. Milk and eggs will provide
ample protein for all purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Albumen in the Urine.</strong>&mdash;Albuminuria is one of the
most frequent complications in pregnant women. It should
be combated and controlled as soon as possible. The allowance
of meat should be cut down or entirely eliminated from
the diet until the urine clears up. When albuminuria is
persistent in spite of efforts to overcome it, the patient must
be placed upon a strict milk diet as used in acute nephritis,
to prevent dangerous complications arising.</p>


<h3>LACTATION</h3>

<p><strong>Diet of Mother.</strong>&mdash;Her dietary need not differ materially
from that to which she is accustomed. She must
avoid indigestible foods or any article which has been proved
to disagree with either the infant or herself.</p>

<p><strong>Factors Regarding Secretion of Milk.</strong>&mdash;Constipation,
worry, nervous excitement, and over-fatigue all have an
unfavorable effect upon the secretion of milk and must
therefore be avoided by the nursing mother.</p>

<p><strong>The Bowels.</strong>&mdash;Constipation of the mother reacts
quickly and unfavorably upon the health and comfort of
the baby, hence it should be avoided by eating coarse
breads, green vegetables, and fruits, when they do not disagree
with the baby, by drinking plenty of water and taking
a certain amount of outdoor exercise to keep her own health
in good condition.</p>

<p><strong>Stimulating the Milk Production.</strong>&mdash;When the milk
supply is deficient it will be advisable for the mother to
drink a glass of milk or a bowl of cereal milk gruel between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
meals. Alcoholic beverages are not necessary to insure an
adequate secretion of milk. The milk or milk gruels answer
the purpose more efficiently and without bad results.</p>

<p><strong>Energy Requirements of Infant.</strong>&mdash;The average baby
requires fifty calories per day per pound of body weight to
cover his energy growth and development needs for the first
three months of life, after which the rate of growth is less
and his requirements decrease from forty-three to forty,
then to thirty-five calories per day per pound by the end
of his first year.</p>

<p><strong>Amount of Milk Needed for Infant.</strong>&mdash;Approximately
two and one-third ounces to each pound of body weight per
day covers the needs of the average baby.</p>

<p><strong>Fuel Value of Mother&rsquo;s Milk.</strong>&mdash;Each ounce of milk
yields twenty calories.</p>

<p><strong>The Making of Milk.</strong>&mdash;It has been estimated that for
every calorie yielded by milk, two extra calories must be
provided by food.</p>

<br />
INFANT FEEDING</h2>


<p>In taking up this part of our study on nutrition, there
are several points to be kept in mind by the nurse: (1) that
it will be difficult, if not impossible, to understand the
metabolic changes taking place in abnormal conditions
unless those occurring in the normal human body are understood;
(2) that certain diseases are due directly to errors in
diet; (3) that in other diseases, diet plays the chief part
both in the bringing about and in the relieving of the conditions;
(4) whereas there are certain other diseases not
affected by diet, save in so far as well or poorly selected and
prepared food always affects the individual, whether normal
or abnormal, and that in the latter conditions the organism
is more susceptible to bad influences.</p>

<p>This being the case it behooves the nurse to examine
herself to find whether or not she understands the fundamental
principles underlying the nutrition of the human
body, that she may efficiently deal with the changes which
occur more or less when the body is attacked by disease.</p>

<p>We include normal infant feeding in this section, because
in no other age is it quite so necessary for care to be observed
in formulating and carrying out a diet. Errors during
this period may only appear to exert a local influence,
causing disturbance which may readily be relieved, but the
danger is in laying too little stress upon these disturbances,
forgetting that the delicate organism of a child may be
permanently injured by a constant disregard of nature&rsquo;s
mandates. In the words of the old adage, the pitcher may
go once too often to the well, and an injured digestive
apparatus is even more difficult to mend than the proverbial
pitcher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
In this section, then, the metabolic changes due to
pathological conditions and the dietetic treatment thereof
will be discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Age and Weight.</strong>&mdash;As has already been stated, there
are certain points to be kept in mind in attempting to provide
an adequate diet for the human machine; <em>First</em>, the
<em>age</em> and <em>weight</em>. The gain during infancy should be steady&mdash;an
allowance of 40 calories per pound of body weight to
cover the energy requirements and 4 protein calories per
pound to cover the nitrogen needs. During the second and
third years the energy requirements will be covered by 30
to 40 calories per pound and the nitrogen needs by 3 to 4
protein calories per pound. From the fifth to the eighth
year the nitrogen needs continue to be covered by 3 to 4
protein calories per pound and the energy requirements by
35 to 37 calories per pound during the fifth year; 32 to 34
calories per pound during the seventh year. After the body
has reached its full development its requirements will be
met if sufficient protein is provided to cover its maintenance
needs and if the energy calories are regulated according
to the amount of exercise taken, keeping in mind that
the energy requirements of a man at rest (sitting) will be
about 2,000 calories per day and that exercise, especially
that taken in the open air, raises the energy needs of the
body.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Gain.</strong>&mdash;In estimating the relative daily gain in
body weight of children of different ages, Mendel<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> gives

<strong>Retention of Nitrogen in Infancy.</strong>&mdash;When the baby
is gaining in weight and strength there is a retention of
both nitrogen and salts, and when the baby is not gaining
there may be a loss of both of these bodies; when one is
retained in the body the other is apt to be retained.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>


<h3>NORMAL INFANT FEEDING</h3>

<p>Much has been written in the past few years on the care
and feeding of infants and children. This is well, since
statistics show an alarming increase in the rate of infant
mortality during the early years of life, and anything which
can be done to check this lamentable and often avoidable
waste of valuable life should be resorted to with care and
attention.</p>

<p><strong>Food for Infants.</strong>&mdash;The natural food of all young mammals
is the milk of their own mother. The rate of growth
and development differs in every species; the calf, for example,
doubles birth weight much more quickly than does
the baby of the same age. However, the milk of the cow,
which meets the needs of the calf perfectly, falls short of
meeting the requirements of the infant, whose rate of
growth is not nearly so rapid. For this reason if for no
other, it would be advisable to give the baby its natural
food rather than to attempt a substitute which is, at best,
a poor one.</p>

<p><strong>Weight.</strong>&mdash;The average infant weighs from six to seven
pounds at birth. This weight should be doubled in the
first five or six months of life and tripled by the end of the
first year. The most important business, then, in the life
of the child during the early years is growth and development.
To achieve this properly the baby&rsquo;s habits must be
adjusted to his needs.</p>

<p><strong>Regularity in Feeding.</strong>&mdash;He must have the proper food
and enough of it, and have it given at regular intervals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
&ldquo;by the clock,&rdquo; for guesswork is fatal in infant feeding. He
must be given water between meals. Babies often cry from
thirst when they are thought to be doing so from hunger
or temper, or both. The healthy baby sleeps about twenty-two
hours out of twenty-four during the early months, and
even during the latter six months of the first year more
time is spent in sleeping than in waking.</p>

<p><strong>The Bowels.</strong>&mdash;The bowels should move several times
a day, the stools being smooth and of a yellowish color, of
the consistency of pea soup. After the first month, twice a
day is about the normal number of stools for the healthy
baby. The infant should be placed upon a vessel held in
the lap of the nurse at regular times, preferably right before
the morning bath, and in the evening. In this way regularity
in evacuating the bowels is obtained, and a habit
formed which will prove valuable through life.</p>

<p><strong>The Bath.</strong>&mdash;The daily bath is likewise necessary for
the health and comfort of all babies; so, too, are fresh air
and sunshine.</p>

<p>As has already been stated, breast milk is much better
for babies than cow&rsquo;s milk or any artificial food. There is
something in the mother&rsquo;s milk which gives strength and
resistance to the baby which is absolutely lacking in any
other food no matter how carefully it is selected and prepared,
and for this reason young mothers must be prevailed
upon to nurse their babies whenever it is possible
for them to do so. When circumstances, such as having to
be away all day at work, make it impossible for a mother
to nurse her baby at regular intervals, she can be taught
how necessary are two or three breast feedings a day to the
future welfare of her child. When social reasons or lack of
desire on the part of the mother make her unwilling to
nurse her baby, it is the part of the nurse to lay the case
before her and let her judge whether or not she is willing
to accept the responsibility of bringing into the world a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
life for which she is unwilling to provide weapons with
which to fight the good fight.</p>

<p><strong>Habits of Mother.</strong>&mdash;The mother must be taught how
to efficiently nurse her baby; she must keep in mind that
upon her good health and temperate habits depend the
health and comfort of her baby. It devolves upon her to
provide food efficient in quality and quantity. To do this,
her own diet must be simple and wholesome. The nursing
mother must remember that she has to provide, not only
for her own maintenance and energy requirements, but
also for the infant whose fuel requirements are ever demanding
more food to provide for its rapid growth.</p>

<p><strong>Food and Its Relation to Milk.</strong>&mdash;It is believed that
two calories of food extra are necessary to produce one
calorie of milk, and since a month-old baby requires 2&#8531;
ounces of mother&rsquo;s milk to every pound of his body weight,
and one ounce of mother&rsquo;s milk will yield 20 calories, it is
clearly seen that the mother will have to increase her diet
to cover the requirements of the baby. For example, if the
baby weighed 12 pounds, he would require 28 ounces of milk
in 24 hours, or 560 calories. Thus if it requires two calories
of extra food to make one calorie of milk, the mother&rsquo;s diet
would have to provide 1,120 calories extra, or about as much
food as would fulfill the needs of a laboring man, 3,000 to
3,500 calories, even if she were doing practically no actual
work; while if she were actively employed and doing a certain
amount of physical labor, her rations would have to
approximate those of a man doing heavy muscular work
(about 3,500 to 4,000 calories per day).<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><strong>Breast Milk versus Cow&rsquo;s Milk.</strong>&mdash;Consensus of opinion
shows that breast-fed infants require less energy than the
ones who must be nourished artificially. This is probably
due largely to the fact that the constituents of human milk
are in a more available form than those in cow&rsquo;s milk, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
former requiring a lesser expenditure of energy on the part
of the organism to become available than the latter. Very
active babies, ones who kick and throw themselves about
or cry violently, have a greater energy requirement than
the more placid baby who sleeps more and is more quiet in
movement and who cries less when awake. Breast-fed
babies are generally more quiet than their less fortunate
artificially fed brothers. It has been demonstrated that the
artificially fed baby has a much harder fight for existence
than the baby who receives his natural food; hence the
necessity of using every available means to make the food
digestible, and to lessen the danger arising from the additional
work put upon the entire apparatus. Cow&rsquo;s milk contains
practically the same chemical elements as are found in
human milk, but these elements are combined in a slightly
different manner, and are not so easily handled by the
immature organs. The proteins of milk consist of casein,
which is insoluble, and albumen, which is soluble. According
to Van Slyke the proportion of insoluble to soluble protein
in cow&rsquo;s milk is 3.6:1, while in human milk the proportion
is only 1:1. The ash constituents in cow&rsquo;s milk are in
excess of the needs of the infant organism, but since a great
part of these salts is in an inorganic form they are not retained
to the same extent as those contained in human milk,
which are in an organic form.</p>

<p><strong>Rules and Regulations.</strong>&mdash;It is not possible to lay down
hard and fast laws to cover the subject of infant feeding.
The food must be adapted to the individual needs of the
baby in question. The nurse must see that the milk is
obtained from a responsible dealer, certified milk being of
course the safest. The bottles of milk should be wiped off
carefully and placed directly on the ice as soon as they are
received. The milk generally used in infant feeding has a
fat content of 4%. That having a higher percentage of
fat is technically cream. The following table showing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>

<p>Seven per cent. (7%) cream is obtained from the upper
16 ounces of a quart bottle of milk which has been allowed
to stand undisturbed for six hours. The upper third of the
bottle contains 10% fat, while the whole fat layer from the
quart bottle, regardless of the number of ounces, contains
about 16% of fat.</p>

<p><strong>Methods of Artificial Feeding.</strong>&mdash;The use of whole milk,
top milk, or skimmed milk, diluted with water, and either
milk sugar, malt sugar, or sucrose (cane sugar) added, is the
method of feeding most commonly used, and upon it are
based the formulas universally advised by infant specialists.
There are cases in which simple dilution is not advisable.
In premature or very young infants, for example, the whey
mixtures have been found to give the best results. In toxic
diarrheas, where the putrefactive bacteria make the use of
all but the minimum amount of protein inadvisable, the
above method is contraindicated, as it is likewise in cases
where vomiting of casein curd is a prominent feature.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p><strong>The Use of Alkalies.</strong>&mdash;There are many cases in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
the physician deems it advisable to add an alkali to the milk
mixture. The one generally selected is limewater. However,
sodium citrate and sodium bicarbonate are also used.
The reasons for adding alkalies to the milk mixtures are:
(1) to check the coagulation of the casein, (2) to hasten the
emptying of the stomach, or (3) to chemically change the
formation of the curd. In certain cases it is only necessary
to delay the coagulation of the casein in the stomach, in
which case a certain amount of limewater is used. Its action
is to swell the protein of the milk and in this way effect
the precipitation of the casein. In other cases it is found
advisable to prevent the formation of curd and hasten its
departure from the stomach. Cannon<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> claims that milk
before it coagulates leaves the stomach quickly like water in
gushes. Hence, if an alkali like limewater, bicarbonate or
citrate of soda is added to the milk this coagulation will be
checked and the digestion be facilitated.</p>

<p><strong>Amount and Type of Alkali Used.</strong>&mdash;The amount of
alkali<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> necessary to bring about any change in the general
effect of the formula must be determined by the amount of
milk and cream in the mixture, since these constituents
alone determine the acid content. However, it is impossible
to judge exactly the amount of alkali to add, but an approximate
estimate is made from the work done by the various
investigators. It has been estimated that from 25 to
50% of limewater must be added to milk to change it
to any marked degree. In using bicarbonate of soda, a
much less quantity brings about the desired result, 1&frac12;
grains of bicarbonate of soda being equal to one ounce of
limewater. The action of these two alkalies is different.
The soda acting upon the milk causes the curds to be more
porous, and therefore more easily acted upon in digestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
Sodium citrate likewise tends to prevent the formation
of tough curds. It is added in amounts of 1 to 2 grains to
each ounce of milk or cream in the mixture whenever it is
found necessary to use it at all.</p>

<p>The addition of any alkali to the formula is resorted to
if the symptoms indicate the need for it, but the type and
quantity is entirely within the province of the physician,
not the nurse.</p>

<p><strong>The Addition of Sugar.</strong>&mdash;<strong>Lactose</strong> is the form in which
the carbohydrates are found in milk, and it has been a general
rule to employ this sugar in making up the sugar content
of a formula, using from 6 to 7% of the mixture
in this form to cover the necessary energy requirements of
the infant. Other sugars are used, however; and of late
years malt sugar has been widely employed for this purpose.
The form now generally accepted is known as <strong>dextri-maltose</strong>,
which is a combination of dextrin and maltose,
both of which are readily acted upon by the sugar-splitting
enzymes of the digestive juices. In digestion, lactose or
milk sugar is split to dextrose and galactose and utilized in
the body, both as a source of energy and as a food for the
lactic acid bacteria which are active in the small intestine.</p>

<p><strong>Malted Foods.</strong>&mdash;The addition of malted foods or malt
sugar to the food of infants tends to bring about a more
rapid gain, both in energy and in body weight, than is generally
the case where other sugars are used. This sugar is
used as a substitute for milk sugar in many formulas, especially
in those cases in which the casein of cow&rsquo;s milk needs
to be made more digestible in form. Malt sugar is indicated
in the following conditions:<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> (1) in severe atrophies, (2) in
cases of fat indigestion before the atrophic stage is reached,
(3) in cases where there is slight curd indigestion, indicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
by some vomiting and slow gain in weight, (4) in cases
where excessive intestinal fermentation is manifested by gas
and colic.</p>

<p><strong>Malt sugar</strong> (dextri-maltose) is contraindicated to a
slight degree in cases &ldquo;of simple acute diarrhea where lactose,
by supplying fermentative media, more easily restores
the normal bacterial balance.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Diluents.</strong>&mdash;Barley and oatmeal water are used as diluents
to the amount of one-fourth or more of the mixture.
Oatmeal water or jelly is used more during the winter
months than in the hot summer months. As the fat content
of the oatmeal gives it a more laxative effect, it is undesirable
to use it at the season in which the summer diarrheas
are prevalent. Barley water has something of a
colloidal action upon the casein, causing the curds to be finer
and less tough in character. Both barley and oatmeal water
are used in place of plain water for babies when this colloidal
effect upon the curd of the milk is desired, also where
the weight of the infant shows a disposition to remain stationary,
especially where there are no other symptoms to
account for the lack of gain.</p>

<p>Whey is used with babies who cannot digest the insoluble
protein of cow&rsquo;s milk. This is often the case in premature
babies and is manifested by a persistent vomiting of
curd. The energy requirements are obtained by the addition
of cream and lactose to the whey.</p>

<p><strong>Buttermilk Mixtures and &ldquo;Eiweissmilch.&rdquo;</strong>&mdash;It is often
found desirable to use some other form of milk than whole,
top, or even skimmed milk, and for this purpose lactic acid,
milk and the albumen or &ldquo;Eiweissmilch&rdquo; are substituted.
In the buttermilk mixtures the precipitation of the casein
is brought about by lactic acid bacilli (Bulgarian culture).
This prevents the coagulation of the casein into tough curds.
Lactose buttermilk or lactic acid milk is used in the feeding
of infants who have persistent green stools, and in cases of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
acute toxic diarrhea brought about through the action of
gas bacillus.</p>

<p>Buttermilk is more difficult to administer to babies than
formulas made from plain milk by reason of its flavor.
However, the results are remarkable in the above-mentioned
conditions.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Eiweissmilch&rdquo;</strong> is used in atrophic cases where there
are bad green stools.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Homogenized Milk.&rdquo;</strong>&mdash;Dr. Ladd of the Children&rsquo;s
Hospital in Boston has presented many cases of infants
who showed an intolerance for butter fat. These cases he
has treated with formulas containing foreign fat, usually
olive oil. This milk is subjected to a treatment which
brings about a more complete emulsification of the fat than
is possible in cow&rsquo;s milk, causing it to resemble in character
the quality of the mother&rsquo;s milk. Homogenized milk has
been used with success in cases where it was impossible to
supply the infant with breast milk.</p>

<p>The process is accomplished by the use of an apparatus
known as an &ldquo;homogenizer&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>; in this machine the fat
globule is crushed and so finely divided as to prevent its
re-formation. The greatest drawback to the use of this
process lies in the scarcity of available machines. Cod
liver oil is now used in many cases where the infant shows a
failure to gain or is in possible danger of developing rickets,
with the homogenizer it is possible to add the oil to the formula,
thus facilitating its use.</p>

<p><strong>Technique of Milk Modification.</strong>&mdash;The absolute necessity
for cleanliness has already been dwelt upon in respect
to milk, and in infant feeding the vigilance which must be
observed in the preparation of the food cannot be too
strongly emphasized. The milk itself must be of known
purity. Where there is any uncertainty about its source, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
must be sterilized or pasteurized according to the doctor&rsquo;s
orders. The bottles and nipples should be washed as soon
as they are used, first with plain water to remove the milk,
then with soapsuds and a bottle brush. The bottles should
then be filled with boric acid or bicarbonate of soda solution
until needed, when they should be emptied and placed in a
deep pan filled with cold water and allowed to boil for a few
minutes. They should not be taken from the water until
they are to be filled with the milk mixture. The nipples are
washed thoroughly and boiled once a day and dropped into
a solution of boric acid or bicarbonate of soda when not in
use. The plain black rubber nipples are best as they can
easily be turned inside out and cleaned. If the milk drops
too slowly from the bottle, the nipple may be pierced in one
or two places with a darning needle.</p>

<p>The morning is the best time in which to prepare the
baby&rsquo;s food; the milk has not stood too long and it is easier
to regulate the feedings if a fresh start is made each morning.
Let the bottles and the rubber corks with which they
must be stopped be boiled and cooled while the milk mixture
is being prepared.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of Diluents.</strong>&mdash;If barley or oatmeal water
is to be used as a diluent, let that be prepared first, that it
may be cool before adding it to the milk. Cover the table
with a clean cloth or oilcloth, upon this place the pitcher
in which the milk is to be modified, have the funnel, milk
dipper, and spoon which are to be used boiled with the bottles,
cover the mouth of the pitcher with a clean square of
gauze or cheesecloth, read the formula carefully and measure
the sugar, dextri-maltose, lactose, Mellin&rsquo;s Food, or cane
sugar as directed and place it in a clean glass; now measure
the diluent, water, oatmeal water, barley water, or whey;
use part of this diluent to dissolve the sugar.</p>

<p><strong>Measuring Milk according to Percentage of Fat.</strong>&mdash;Now
dip off the required layer of top milk, that is, the layer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
containing the desired percentage of fat and protein. Mix
this thoroughly and dip out the requisite number of ounces
into the pitcher. If there is not sufficient cream in one
quart bottle to fill the formula, the cream must be dipped
from a second bottle and mixed with that of the first before
it is measured into the pitcher. The dissolved sugar and
rest of the diluent, together with the correct amount of
limewater, are strained into the pitcher, mixed thoroughly,
and strained through the absorbent cotton lining the funnel
into the bottles, allowing the correct number of ounces for
each feeding in every bottle.</p>

<p><strong>Pasteurizing the Milk.</strong>&mdash;The corks are then adjusted,
the bottles placed in the pasteurizer<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and pasteurized for
the desired number of minutes. The water in the pasteurizer
must be cold in the beginning and the rise of temperature
recorded on the thermometer, which is adjusted at
a convenient place in the pasteurizer where the scale can be
read easily. If the temperature of the water is too high,
add cold water and lower the flame beneath the pasteurizer.
When the desired number of minutes has elapsed, lift the
bottle rack above the water for a few minutes and allow a
stream of cold water to flow into the pasteurizer, taking care
not to chill the bottles too suddenly or they will crack. Cool
the bottles as quickly as possible and place on ice until
needed, warming the bottle of milk as needed in warm
water.</p>

<p><strong>Amount Given at Each Feeding.</strong>&mdash;At birth a baby will
usually take from one half to one ounce at each feeding,
this amount is increased at the rate of a quarter of an ounce
each week until the baby is receiving eight ounces at each
feeding. Or the food is measured to allow of from one ounce
to an ounce and a half more than the child&rsquo;s age in months.
For example a baby six months old would receive from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
seven to seven and a half ounces at each feeding. Some
babies are bigger and stronger than others and require the
maximum amount, while others are less vigorous and the
amount of food which they can handle at a feeding may
fall slightly short of the above amounts, but the quantities
indicated above will serve as a guide in measuring the
formula.</p>

<p><strong>Method of Calculation of Formula.</strong>&mdash;The calculation
of a formula consists in determining the amount (in grams
or ounces), of the various constituents contained in the
formula when the percentage of each is known. Or, in
determining its percentage composition when the amount
of fat, protein, carbohydrate and diluent is given. There
are certain inaccuracies in all simple methods of calculation
and the use of the Babcock tester to determine the fat content
in the milk to be used, is advised in all milk or formula
rooms. The following method of calculation has been
found satisfactory, and the nurse must master it in order to
intelligently carry out the directions of the pediatrist.</p>

<p><strong>Determining the Composition of Formula.</strong><a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>&mdash;Gravity
cream and skimmed milk are used in this method, the cream
is estimated as containing 16% fat, and consists of the
entire cream layer from a quart bottle of milk which has
been allowed to stand without being disturbed for six hours
or longer. The cream must be dipped off with a cream
dipper, or poured off. If there is not a sufficient number of
ounces in one bottle of milk, a second must be used, the
entire cream layer taken, then mixed with that obtained
from first bottle, before the required number of ounces are
measured off. Skimmed milk is estimated as being fat-free
(although this is not entirely accurate). Both gravity
cream and skimmed milk are estimated as containing
3.2% protein, and 4.5% sugar. In this method,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
one rounded tablespoonful of milk sugar is estimated as
weighing one half ounce (dextri-maltose may be estimated
in the same way). With this brief explanation of the terms
used we will proceed with the method itself.</p>

<p>It is always essential before beginning the calculation of
the formula, to know what percentages of fat, sugar,
and protein it is to contain, and the amount to be given in
twenty-four hours; it is also necessary to know how much
lime water is to be added if this substance is to form a part
of the formula.</p>

<p>Suppose a thirty-two-ounce mixture is to be made containing
3% of fat, 6% of sugar, 2% of protein, and lime
water sufficient to equal 25% of the cream and skimmed
milk in the mixture. The fat in the food must be derived
from cream, since it is the only substance containing fat to
be used in the formula. If the food was composed entirely
of gravity cream it would contain 16% of fat. Since it is to
contain but 3% of fat it is evident that only 3/16 of the
mixture must be gravity cream, 3/16 of thirty-two ounces
is six ounces. Six ounces of gravity cream will, therefore,
provide the 3% of fat desired in the mixture. The gravity
cream contains protein as well as fat. There are six ounces
of gravity cream in the thirty-two-ounce mixture. The
protein content of gravity cream is 3.2%. The protein
content of a thirty-two-ounce mixture containing six
ounces of gravity cream is evidently 6/32 of 3.2% or
0.60%. Two per cent protein is, however, desired in
the mixture. The gravity cream has provided only
0.60%. One and forty hundredths per cent of protein, the
difference between the percentage of protein desired and
that furnished by the gravity cream, must be obtained in
some other way. It must be obtained, moreover, from some
substance which does not contain fat. Skimmed milk is
such a substance. Skimmed milk contains 3.2% protein.
In order to get 1.40 per cent in the mixture by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
use of skimmed milk, it is evident that 140/320 of the mixture
must be skimmed milk. 140/320 of thirty-two ounces
is fourteen ounces. Fourteen ounces of skimmed milk will,
therefore, provide the additional 1.40% of protein desired.</p>

<p>Both gravity cream and skimmed milk contain 4.50%
milk sugar. Twenty ounces of gravity and skimmed
milk are required to furnish the desired percentages of fat
and protein. These twenty ounces in a thirty-two-ounce
mixture must add 20/32 or 4.50% of sugar to the
mixture. Twenty thirty-seconds of 4&frac12; or 20/32 of 9/2
= 180/64, or practically 3% of milk sugar. It is, however,
desired to have 6% of milk sugar in the mixture.
That is, 3% more of milk sugar is required. This
additional sugar must be added in the form of dry milk
sugar. Three per cent of thirty-two ounces is 3/100 of
thirty-two. This will give the amount of sugar desired in
ounces. The sugar is to be measured in rounded tablespoonfuls,
or half ounces. If the figures given above are
multiplied by two, the result will be the number of rounded
tablespoonfuls needed. That is, 3/100 of 32 &times; 2 = 192/100
rounded tablespoonfuls, or for all practical purposes, two
rounded tablespoonfuls.</p>

<p>It is also desired to have the amount of lime water in the
mixture equal to 25% of the cream and milk in the
mixture. There are twenty ounces of cream and milk in
the mixture. Twenty-five per cent of twenty ounces is five
ounces. Five ounces of lime water must therefore be added.
The total quantity of the mixture is to be thirty-two ounces.
The milk sugar goes into solution and, therefore, does not
add to this quantity. The difference between thirty-two
and twenty-five ounces is seven ounces. Seven ounces of
water must, therefore, be added to make up the quantity
desired.</p>

<p><strong>Changing the Formula.</strong>&mdash;It is often found necessary
to change the formula when using artificial feeding for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
infants, and under these circumstances it is necessary to know
the percentages of the food constituents contained in the
formula already in use. For this purpose the following
method, quoted from &ldquo;Diseases of Nutrition and Infant
Feeding,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> is included:</p>

<p><strong>Morse and Talbot&rsquo;s Method.</strong>&mdash;Suppose that a baby is
taking a food made up of&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;The barley water is made with two teaspoonfuls of
barley flour in a pint of water. The total quantity of the
mixture is 48 ounces. Gravity cream contains 16% fat.
Twelve ounces of gravity cream in a 48-ounce mixture will
give, therefore, 12/48 of 16% of fat, or 4% fat. Both gravity
cream and skimmed milk contain 3.20% protein. There
are 30 ounces of gravity cream and skimmed milk in the
mixture; 30 ounces in a 48-ounce mixture will give 30/48 of
3.20% of protein, or 2.00% of protein. Both gravity cream
and skimmed milk also contain 4.50% of sugar. Thirty
ounces of gravity cream and skimmed milk in a 48-ounce
mixture will therefore furnish 30/48 of 4&frac12; which is the
same as 30/48 of 9/2 or almost 3.00% of milk sugar. Four
rounded tablespoonfuls of milk sugar are equal to two
ounces. Two ounces of sugar in a 48-ounce mixture is equal
to 2/48 of 100% or 4%. The total percentage of sugar is,
therefore, 7%. Two teaspoonfuls of barley flour in a pint
of water makes a 1.50% decoction of starch. Twelve ounces
of barley water of this strength in a 48-ounce mixture will
give 12/48 of 1.50% or about 0.35% starch. There are six
ounces of limewater in the mixture and 30 ounces of gravity
cream and skimmed milk. 6/30 of 100% is 20%. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
limewater is, therefore, 20% of the milk and cream. The
mixture thus contains 4% fat, 7% sugar, 2% protein, and
0.35% starch, while the limewater is in the proportion of
20% of the cream and milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If, therefore, the nurse will follow out the plan suggested
by Drs. Morse and Talbot, it should be a simple matter
to change the percentage of any of the food constituents
in any formula.</p>

<p>The following schemes for feeding well babies are included
to facilitate the work in the home. A nurse may
teach the mother the manner in which these schemes are
used, keeping in mind that there can be no iron clad rule for
feeding all babies. No nurse should recommend a formula
without directions from a physician. And no formula
should be changed without his permission.</p>

<p>At end of 11th month add 1-2 pieces of stale bread, toast or zwieback.
Part of soft-cooked egg may be given every other day at noon
meal by end of 11th month. The orange juice may be increased to
3 tbs. if bowels are not loose.</p>

<p>The strained cereal should be given twice daily by the end of the
first year, and the milk should be undiluted at this time unless the
digestion of the infant forbids.</p>

<p>Cooled boiled water should be given several times each day between
feedings. Babies cry from thirst as well as from hunger.</p>

<p>From this point on the formula may be increased by replacing the
boiled water with whole milk, two ounces each month up to thirteen
months. At this age the boiled water may be omitted from the
formula one ounce each week. Beginning at the age of eight months
the sugar may be eliminated from the formula, one tablespoonful
each month.</p>

<p><i>Barley Water.</i>&mdash;At the age of five months, or at any time thereafter,
barley water may be substituted for boiled water in the formula.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
This should be substituted when the baby is not gaining in weight.
It may be substituted in many instances when the movements are not
well digested.</p>

<p><i>Lime Water.</i>&mdash;It is frequently found to be advisable to add lime
water. It is not necessary in every instance, but should be given if
the baby is inclined to spit up, or in cases where the stools are too
frequent in number and are slightly green in color.</p>


<p class="hrpad"><strong>Determining the Fuel Value of a Formula.</strong>&mdash;The
computation of the fuel value of a formula is very essential
since the growth and development of the infant depends
largely upon whether or not its energy expenditures are
well covered. The method is simple, requiring the same
methods used in the computing of other dietaries. Take the
formula just calculated, its fuel value would be estimated
as follows: Thirty-two ounces are equal to 960 grams. In
each 100 grams there would be 3 grams of fat, 2 grams of
protein and 6 grains of sugar. Hence in 9.6 one-hundred-calorie
portions there would be 9.6 &times; 3&mdash;28.8 grams of fat,
9.6 &times; 2&mdash;19.2 grams of protein, and 9.6 &times; 6&mdash;57.6 grams
of sugar, in a thirty-two-ounce mixture.</p>

<p>To determine the fuel value of the formula, these results
must be multiplied by their physiological fuel factors, 9 and
4 and 4 respectively. Thus:</p>

chops, and scraped beef.</p>

<p>The following dietary is suggested for a child two years

<p>It will be seen in the foregoing dietaries how authorities
differ in their beliefs as to the requirements of the child.

have successfully cared for the infants and children under
their charge.</p>


<h3>THE FEEDING OF PREMATURE INFANTS</h3>

<p>The digestion of premature infants is naturally not as
strong as that of infants born at term. Very little is positively
known, but the consensus of opinion goes to show
that in the majority of cases the tolerance for sugar is
greater than that of either the proteins or fats. The loss of
heat is relatively greater in proportion to its surface area
in small than in large bodies. This is a well-known fact,
hence the premature baby must require more food in proportion
to its weight than the baby who is born at the normal
time. Then, too, as the premature infant is thinner he
does not keep warm like the older infant, and this must be
taken into consideration in feeding him. Breast milk is of
course by far the best food for such babies, not only because
its constituents are in a more available form for the feeble
digestive organs, but because the mother&rsquo;s milk furnishes a
resistance which is lacking in even the most carefully modified
of milk formulas.</p>

<p><strong>Energy Requirements of Premature Infants.</strong>&mdash;Experiments
made upon premature infants have proved that
the caloric needs of these babies are greater than in the case
of full-time babies; that is, they require more per kilogram
of body weight. According to Morse,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> &ldquo;most premature
babies need 120 calories per kilogram of body weight. But
there are many exceptions, some thriving on as little as 70
calories per kilogram. No attempt should be made to reach
120 calories per kilogram during the first few days. Thirty
calories per kilogram is as much as is wise to give in the first
24 hours of feeding. This amount should be gradually increased
each day, watching carefully for symptoms of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
indigestion and diminishing it if these appear. One hundred
and twenty calories per kilogram can be given in about 10
days.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p><strong>Necessary Dilution.</strong>&mdash;Even breast milk must be diluted
with an equal amount of water or a 3% sugar solution.
The amount of milk should be increased and the amount of
dilution decreased until the undiluted breast milk is given
in four or five days. Like older babies, the next best food
for premature babies is the properly modified cow&rsquo;s milk,
but the utmost care will have to be observed, as these babies
are more easily upset than older and stronger ones.</p>

<p><strong>Premature Infant Feeding.</strong>&mdash;The following method of
feeding may be suggested, keeping in mind that it is an easy
matter to increase the strength of a mixture if the baby
shows the need of such an increase. The premature baby is
rarely strong enough to take the breast.</p>

<p><strong>Method of Administering Milk.</strong>&mdash;The most satisfactory
method of administering the food in such cases is by
means of the Brick feeder, which consists of a graduated
glass tube, open at either end. On the small end is placed
a small nipple like those seen on medicine droppers; this one
is perforated and goes into the mouth of the baby. A large
rubber finger cot is attached to the other end of the tube.
The milk is forced into the mouth by pressing the finger cot.
In case the infant is too feeble even for this method of
feeding, the desired amount is dropped into the mouth from
a medicine dropper; 5 c.c. (about 1 dram or 1 teaspoonful)
of diluted milk being given at each feeding. This amount is
increased gradually from day to day.</p>

<p><strong>Whey Mixtures.</strong>&mdash;Whey mixtures have been found to
meet the needs of premature infants more efficiently than
ordinary mixtures. As the proteins in whey are in a more
digestible form, they throw less work on the immature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
digestive apparatus. As a rule the casein and whey are in
proportion of 1:1.</p>

<p>The following formulas<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> show the amounts in which
the food constituents are combined and are suitable for
premature babies:</p>

<h3>PROPRIETARY FOODS</h3>

<p>A word as to the use of Proprietary Infant Foods: These
prepared foods may be classified under four heads, as follows:
(1) condensed milks; (2) malted foods, those consisting
chiefly of carbohydrates in the form of maltose and dextrins;
(3) those consisting almost entirely of starch, and (4)
those composed partly of soluble and partly of insoluble
carbohydrates.</p>

<p>(1) Condensed milk may be sweetened or unsweetened.
These milks are never given undiluted, the directions calling
for one part condensed milk to nine parts water, which gives
a mixture containing 0.90% fat, 5.49% sugar, and 0.80%
protein if &ldquo;Eagle Brand&rdquo; Condensed Milk is used.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>(2) Malted Foods: Mellin&rsquo;s Food and malted milk are
examples of this group. These foods contain the carbohydrates
in soluble form and when added to milk make an
acceptable addition, as they furnish the carbohydrates in
the most digestible form. When fed alone, diluted only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
with water, they result in a mixture deficient in both fat
and protein.</p>

<p>(3) Imperial Granum is an example of this group, and
there are several others with similar compositions. These
foods are very much like wheat flour which has been subjected
to heat, changing to a small extent the starch to
dextrose and dextrin.</p>

<p>(4) Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s Food, Eskay&rsquo;s Albumenized Food, and Allenbury&rsquo;s
Food are examples of this group, each containing
sugar and a percentage of starch. Upon dilution with
water, the amount of fat in the mixture is just a trace.</p>

<p><strong>Incomplete Foods as a Source of Danger.</strong>&mdash;The ease
with which the majority of these foods are prepared and
the way in which they agree with the baby constitute the
chief danger of their use. If they are added to milk, with
the exception of the condensed milk, they result in a modified
milk containing the carbohydrates in a more or less
digested form. But they are expensive, and give no better
result as a rule than a carefully modified milk containing
a cereal gruel.</p>

<p>The giving of foods like malted milk alone is dangerous
because they are deficient in some of the most necessary
constituents, and babies fed in this way, while growing fat,
are apt to have soft or brittle bones and muscular tissue
higher in fat and water than in protein, so that they do not
grow and develop in a normal way, and when they are attacked
by the diseases so prevalent in the early years of life,
they succumb rapidly, because the resistance given by a
properly modified food is lacking.</p>

<p>Condensed milks act in a like manner. That is, in the
sweetened milks the carbohydrate content is far in excess
of the needs, and the proteins and fats are deficient, so that
while the baby fattens he does not receive the building
foods commensurate with his body requirements.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
Many mothers adopt the use of these foods because they
mean less work than in modifying the milk properly, but
the nurse should point out the facts just mentioned, explaining
that while these proprietary infant foods are undoubtedly
valuable at times to fill a place when the milk
formula has not proved satisfactory, the use of these foods
as a regular custom is expensive, not only from a financial
standpoint but from a standpoint of health, since their disadvantages
far outweigh their advantages in the long run.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p><strong>Breast Milk as a Food.</strong>&mdash;The superiority of breast milk
over any other known food cannot be too strongly emphasized.</p>

<p><strong>Regularity in Feeding.</strong>&mdash;The absolute need for regularity
in feeding&mdash;&ldquo;feeding by the clock&rdquo; and not by guess
or when the baby cries.</p>

<p><strong>Indications of Health.</strong>&mdash;The normal growth and development
to be used as guides as to the physical well-being
of the infant; also as an indication of the use of the proper
modification of milk for the individual needs of the child.</p>

<p><strong>Dilution.</strong>&mdash;The amount of dilution necessary&mdash;cereal
waters, whey, etc.&mdash;to increase the digestibility and nutrient
values of the formula.</p>

<p><strong>The Addition of Alkali.</strong>&mdash;The addition of alkalies to
milk formulas to accomplish a like purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Milk Sugar, Malt Sugar, Cane Sugar.</strong>&mdash;The use of the
different sugars, namely, dextri-maltose, lactose, or cane
sugar under various circumstances as the condition of the
infant demands.</p>

<p><strong>Substitutes for Whole Milk.</strong>&mdash;The substitution of different
milk, such as lactic acid milk, Bulgarian culture buttermilk,
Eiweissmilch, cream and whey mixtures, as the
individual needs of the infant demand.</p>

<p><strong>Technique of Milk Modifications.</strong>&mdash;The absolute need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
for the nurse to understand the technique of milk modification
before attempting the care of an artificially fed infant.</p>

<p><strong>Percentage Computation.</strong>&mdash;A knowledge of percentage,
that an accurate computation of a formula may be
accomplished.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of Food.</strong>&mdash;A sufficient knowledge of food
preparation to enable the nurse to prepare any food which
may be deemed necessary by the physician for the welfare
of the child.</p>

<p><strong>Water.</strong>&mdash;The importance of giving the baby water
aside from that used in modifying the milk. Many babies
cry from thirst when they are believed to be crying from
hunger or temper.</p>

<p><strong>Increasing the Diet.</strong>&mdash;The necessity for increasing the
amount and strength of the formula with the age, growth,
and development of the child by the addition of solid food
as soon as the physician deems it advisable.</p>

<p><strong>Feeding Premature Infants.</strong>&mdash;The method of feeding
a premature infant differs from that employed in feeding an
infant born at term: (<i>a</i>) because its development has not
progressed so far; (<i>b</i>) because its digestive apparatus being
more or less immature, food handled with ease by an older
baby will be totally unfit for the premature one, both as to
quality and quantity.</p>

<p><strong>Wet Nurse.</strong>&mdash;The advisability of procuring a wet nurse
when the mother is unable to nurse the infant, (<i>a</i>) on account
of the more digestible character of the food constituents,
especially the proteins, in mother&rsquo;s milk over
those of cow&rsquo;s milk; (<i>b</i>) on account of the resistance furnished
by the natural food which has been proved to be very
much greater than that furnished by any other food, no
matter how carefully the modification of the milk is made.</p>

<p><strong>Premature Infants.</strong>&mdash;Their caloric needs are greater
than in full-term babies, hence their food must be adjusted
to meet these needs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
In fact the nurse must have an understanding of the
behavior of foods in the metabolism of infancy and the
laws which govern their use in the organism of the child.</p>

<br />
CARE AND FEEDING OF INFANTS AND CHILDREN
IN ABNORMAL CONDITIONS AND IN
INFECTIOUS DISEASES</h2>


<p><strong>Digestive Disturbances.</strong>&mdash;It is a well-established fact
that artificially fed infants are more subject to disturbances
due to diet than breast-fed infants, the digestional disturbances
of the latter yielding more readily to treatment. As
a rule, with the breast-fed baby it is largely a question of
adjusting the diet of the mother, of increasing the fluid in
her diet, of seeing that she takes the requisite amount of
exercise in the open air, and of lengthening the intervals
between feedings or of giving the baby water just before
putting him to the breast. With the artificially fed infant
it is an entirely different proposition.</p>

<p><strong>Causes in Artificially Fed Infants.</strong>&mdash;The digestive disturbances
may arise from any one of half a dozen or more
causes. The constituents in the milk may be in the wrong
proportion. The amount given at a feeding may be too
great or too little. The dilution may be too great or too
small to meet the needs of the infant. Or the milk may
contain the micro&ouml;rganisms which bring about fermentation
or putrefaction. Any or all of these causes may assail the
artificially fed baby. Consequently, all the care that can be
exercised must be resorted to in the feeding of these babies,
not only after digestional disturbances arise, but as a means
of their prevention. In the preceding chapter the methods
generally used in the feeding of normal infants were discussed.
We now proceed to the feeding under abnormal or
pathological conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
<strong>Errors in Diet.</strong>&mdash;The majority of the ills from which
the baby suffers can be traced primarily to <strong>errors in diet</strong> and
in most of these cases the treatment consists chiefly in adjusting
the formula to suit the condition. As a rule, these
errors may be placed under two heads: those that are
brought on by under-feeding and those induced by over-feeding.
The pathological conditions arising from under-feeding
are due not only to a lack of food, but chiefly to the
improper balancing of the different food constituents in the
formula. As has already been stated, so much food is required
to cover the energy expenditures, so much for maintenance,
and so much for storage for the growth and development
necessary during the entire period from birth to
maturity. These constituents must be regulated to the
individual needs of the infant.</p>

<p><strong>Over-&nbsp;and Under-dilution.</strong>&mdash;If the dilution is too great,
the infant, while receiving the correct amount of the mixture,
may have the necessary food constituents so reduced
as to have them fail completely to do their appointed work
in the body. Or if the amount of diluent is too small the
baby may be receiving too strong a mixture, and develop
nutritional disturbances therefrom. Under the first head
the child suffers from under-feeding; the appetite is satisfied
before enough of the actual food is ingested to meet his
various needs. However, it is probable that the artificially
fed infant suffers from the results of over-, rather than of
under-feeding.</p>


<h3>DISEASES DUE TO ERRORS IN DIET</h3>

<p>Gastro-intestinal disturbances, colic, enterocolitis, colitis,
etc., rickets, scurvy, nephritis, and diabetes are among the
diseases most apt to develop from injudicious feeding, and
in these cases the dietetic treatment plays the most important
part in combating the condition. The disturbances
caused by food are recognized by the general symptoms:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
vomiting, rise of temperature, subnormal temperature, and
the stools, the latter being the chief point of observation.</p>

<p><strong>Fats as Cause.</strong>&mdash;When the fats are causing the disturbance,
the rise of temperature is apt to be high, but not of
long duration. The baby vomits frequently, the vomitus
being acid in reaction and odor, the latter due to the presence
of fatty acids, butyric acid, etc. Diarrhea often develops
in a more or less acute form. In these cases there is
a loss of sodium and other alkaline salts in the feces, and a
consequent excess of ammonia in the urine, resulting in
acidosis. Acid intoxication has been known to develop as
a result of this loss of alkaline salts. The chief symptoms
of this condition are rapid and deep respiration, stupor or
restlessness, and cherry-red lips.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p><strong>Symptoms of Excess Fat in Diets.</strong>&mdash;The general
symptoms in infants receiving an excess of fat in their food
take the form of loss of appetite, with more or less loss of
weight, or failure to gain. When the cases are not chronic,
soft curds may often be seen, which are at times mistaken
for casein curds, but may be distinguished from them by
their translucent appearance and their solubility in ether.
The color of the stools due to the excess of fat under the
above-mentioned conditions is shiny and gray. In the majority
of cases, especially of a more chronic character, the
stools are apt to be large and dry, at times hard and crumbly.
The fat in such stools is combined with magnesium
and calcium salts, forming the characteristic &ldquo;soap stools.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
The combined loss of these salts in the feces has a definite
effect on the general metabolism and nutrition, giving rise
to rickets.</p>

<p><strong>Regulating the Fat.</strong>&mdash;The treatment consists chiefly
of regulating the amount of fat in the formula, and of cutting
it out altogether in the beginning when the symptoms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
show acute acid conditions. In many cases, if the baby is
given breast milk, the trouble disappears. At other times
it is necessary to substitute a foreign fat such as olive oil
for the butter fat. Dr. Ladd in the Children&rsquo;s Hospital in
Boston treated many babies who manifested an intolerance
for butter fat with &ldquo;Homogenized Milk,&rdquo; which consisted
of skimmed or separated milk and a certain percentage of
olive oil, placed in an apparatus which brought about a
more complete division of the fat, causing it to mix with the
milk as an emulsion closely resembling human milk.</p>

<p>Fat intolerance is most difficult to overcome, the baby
being apt to relapse into the acute stage unless the utmost
caution is observed in adding the fats to the formula. It
is not safe, however, to feed the baby upon a fat-free milk
for any great length of time.</p>

<p><strong>Excess Protein in Food.</strong>&mdash;The digestional disturbances
arising from too much protein in the food are as a rule
readily overcome in breast-fed infants. When it is due to
nervousness or worry in the mother, it disappears as soon as
the mother ceases to worry or does something to remove the
cause of the nervous condition. When the breast milk is
high in protein, more exercise in the open air at times adjusts
the percentage of protein, provided the mother does
not become over-tired, in which case the percentage of
protein in breast milk increases.</p>

<p><strong>Evidences of Excess Protein.</strong>&mdash;The symptoms of excess
protein in the diet of the breast-fed baby are colic and
flatulence, which are often persistent and difficult to overcome.
Vomiting is not so common in these babies as in
those who are artificially fed. The stools are increased in
number, are either brown or green, and generally loose and
watery. In artificially fed infants the symptoms are much
the same, except that the vomitus often contains large curds
which are tough and leathery. The baby suffers from gas
formation and colic. The stools are at times normal, except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
for the presence of large, hard curds; at other times they are
increased in number, and are of a watery consistency and
alkaline in reaction.</p>

<p><strong>Regulating the Protein in Formula.</strong>&mdash;When the stools
are watery and brown and musty in odor as the result of
disturbed protein digestion, the treatment consists of taking
out the proteins from the formula and of substituting cereal
water, to which dextri-maltose or milk sugar is added, the
milk being added as soon as possible to prevent too great a
loss of body protein. As a rule the whey proteins do not
cause the disturbances so often as the casein proteins; and
at times it is possible to use whey mixtures with babies who
cannot tolerate the casein at all.</p>

<p>Buttermilk also is used in cases of protein indigestion,
as is Eiweissmilch and peptonized milk.</p>

<p><strong>Regulating the Carbohydrates.</strong>&mdash;When the disturbances
are due to the carbohydrates in the formula, they
may be digestional or nutritional. In this form the milk
sugar is more apt to be the cause of the trouble than the
dextri-maltose preparations which are at times used. In
the latter, when the disturbance becomes nutritional, the
cause of the trouble can usually be traced to an excess of
starch. When the percentage of milk sugar is greater than
can be handled by the digestive apparatus of the baby, it
is manifested by frequent attacks of colic, with the passage
of watery green stools, highly irritating, in character on account
of their acidity. In acute cases the loss of weight is
often marked, and symptoms of intoxication may develop.
The outlook is grave in the very severe cases, but if the baby
can survive forty-eight hours after the acute symptoms develop,
he is apt to pull through the attack.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusting the Sugars.</strong>&mdash;The treatment in these conditions
consists of eliminating the milk sugar from the formula;
in less severe cases dextri-maltose may be substituted.
As a rule, coincident with indigestion caused by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
sugar there will be found to be an intolerance for much fat,
so that this must be adjusted as well as the milk sugar.
Skimmed milk mixtures, containing a certain amount of
barley or oatmeal water, are generally found to be suitable
in these cases. Dextri-maltose may be added after a few
days in order to maintain the fuel needs of the body.
Eiweissmilch is at times used, but whey mixtures are contraindicated
on account of their high sugar content.</p>

<p>Dextri-maltose also disagrees at times. The baby has
colic and flatulence, the stools are usually loose or watery
and dark brown in color. The dietetic treatment consists
of an immediate withdrawal of the dextri-maltose preparation
and a substitution of milk sugar after a few days.</p>

<p><strong>Evidences of Excess Starch in Formula.</strong>&mdash;The disturbances
arising from an excess of starch in the diet are, as
has already been stated, more apt to be of a chronic than an
acute character. Vomiting is not a common symptom under
these conditions, although colic is frequent. The stools are
at times loose and brown, at other times dry and small.
The baby at times suffers from diarrhea and at others from
constipation. When the disturbance is acute the starch
must be entirely eliminated from the formula. If proprietary
foods are being used containing starch, whether it is
dextrinized or unchanged, they must be at once abandoned,
and a formula made up of protein with sugar and fat.</p>

These Conditions</h4>

  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>They likewise advise whey and whey mixtures under these
circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Fermentation.</strong>&mdash;Fermentation is often the cause of infantile
indigestion. At times it is acute and may cause a
decided elevation of temperature owing to the absorption
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
of the toxic substances formed as a result of the bacterial
action. In almost every case of indigestion brought on by
fermentation there will be an accompanying diarrhea. As a
rule the carbohydrates are more liable to the attacks of
bacteria in the stomach than the other food constituents.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The treatment consists first of starvation,
no food being given for at least twenty-four hours. Then
water or weak tea, sweetened with saccharin, may be given,
but nothing else. The medical treatment must be left to
the discretion of the physician. When the condition warrants
a return to food the formula must be made weaker
than that which has caused the disturbance. Malt soup
mixtures, buttermilk mixtures, whey and albumen water
may be added as the condition of the baby improves. In
older children the period of starvation may have to exceed
that of infants, but a gradual return to normal diet is made.
Weak tea and toast may be given after the first twenty-four
hours and well skimmed meat broths, soft-cooked eggs,
liquid peptonoids, and malted milk added to the diet as the
condition of the child improves.</p>


<h3>ENTEROCOLITIS</h3>

<p>The dietetic treatment for enterocolitis must be adjusted
according to the principal symptom. In some of
these cases diarrhea is most prominent, while in others
constipation is the most marked symptom. Hence the diet
must be such as not only to do no harm to the child, but one
that will aid in his ultimate recovery.</p>


<h3>DIARRHEA</h3>

<p>The treatment for diarrhea, whether it is from fermentation
or putrefaction of food, has already been explained.
The grave danger in the putrefactive diarrhea is the absorption
of the toxic substances which result from bacterial
action upon the unabsorbed food material in the small and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
large intestine. In these cases auto-intoxication may develop
and the baby may die before the condition yields to
treatment. The entire intestine must be cleansed as a rule.
The stomach of the baby may be reached with little trouble
by using a small rubber catheter attached to a glass funnel
and a solution of bicarbonate of soda. The bowels may be
emptied by means of a soapsuds enema. Older children
may be given oil, but this of course comes under the jurisdiction
of the physician.</p>


<h3>CONSTIPATION</h3>

<p>Constipation is one of the most frequent troubles visited
upon people of all ages. &ldquo;It is not a disease, it is a condition
in which the number of stools is less or the consistency
of the stools is greater than is normal for the individual at
the given time.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> It may be caused by neglect of the
bowels, which should be evacuated once or twice every day
during infancy and once a day after that period. If the
habit of emptying the bowels every day is established in
infancy it adds much to the health and comfort of the
individual during the entire remainder of life. Babies are
sometimes constipated as the result of the opium administered
in soothing sirups. Others inherit constipation, while
still others are constipated by the taking of the wrong kind
of food or too little food. In any case it is decidedly bad to
resort to drugs, since the habit of taking cathartics is so
easily acquired and so difficult to overcome.</p>

<p><strong>Factors Inducing Constipation.</strong>&mdash;With artificially fed
babies a formula which contains too high a percentage of
diluent and too low a percentage of solids will cause constipation,
chiefly because the solids are so completely absorbed
that they have no residue to form feces. A formula
with too low a fat content in proportion to its protein and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
carbohydrates may cause constipation because the latter
two constituents are almost entirely absorbed, and the feces,
which is largely made up of the fat, is correspondingly
small. Excess of fat, however, has been proved to be one
of the chief causes of constipation in infants, as has also
been the case with excess starch. Boiling the milk for the
baby at times results in constipation. Hence sterilization
is more frequently to blame for the condition than the pasteurization
of milk.</p>

<p><strong>Constipation during Second Year.</strong>&mdash;During the second
year, if the child is given too much milk and too little solid
food, constipation is very apt to be the result. A maximum
quantity of from thirty-two to forty ounces may be given.
In many diseases brought on by malnutrition, constipation
is an obstinate condition to be overcome. This is especially
the case in rickets and anemia.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Laxative Foods.</strong>&mdash;After the baby is a few
months old, orange juice is given between the morning feedings.
Malted foods likewise exert a laxative effect. The
higher the percentage of maltose, the more laxative the
food. The nurse must keep this point in mind in feeding
babies. With older children and adults, the question of
diet for constipation is quite as important as it is for infants.
Prunes or figs cooked with senna leaves and thoroughly
strained furnish an excellent adjunct to the diet under such
conditions. The coarse breads such as bran and Graham
or wholewheat bread should be used instead of white flour
breads. Care should be taken in advising a cereal diet for
children, since cereals, with the exception of oats, are apt
to be constipating. Fresh fruits, stewed fruits, and fresh
vegetables are all good under the above-mentioned conditions.
Young children require the vegetables strained or
cut fine. Adults should include one coarse vegetable a day
in their dietary to obviate the development of constipation.
Children should be taught to drink plenty of water, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
babies should not be neglected in this respect. As a rule
very few adults drink as much water as is necessary for the
general welfare of their bodies.</p>


<h3>SCURVY</h3>

<p>There is probably no disease of infancy which has come
in for more study in the past few years than scurvy.</p>

<p><strong>Cause.</strong>&mdash;The disease is believed to be directly due to
a deficiency in the diet of the antiscorbutic vitamine, known
as &ldquo;Water soluble C.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Treatment.</strong>&mdash;For many years it was known that lime
juice exerted a curative effect upon scurvy. But recently
the efficiency of this fruit juice has proved to fall far short
of that effected by either orange, or tomato juice.</p>

<p>Feeding experiments have proved that animals, fed
upon rations consisting of dry food without the addition of
green, will develop scurvy. And that the milk of such animals
will show a deficiency in the &ldquo;C&rdquo; vitamine which will
lead to a development of the disease in infants fed upon
such milk.</p>

<p>Milk is, in fact, by no means a perfect food, so far as
its vitamine content is concerned. First, because the presence
of the vitamine in milk is so dependent upon the diet
of the mother or the animal, second, because the pasteurization
temperatures used to insure cow&rsquo;s milk of purity from
a bacterial standpoint, destroys in it the greater part of its
antiscorbutic power. Either of which makes it necessary
to supplement the formula of the artificially fed infant, and,
in case of the former, the mother&rsquo;s milk of the breast-fed
baby, with orange, or canned tomato juice.</p>

<p>The amount of either of the fruit juices which is necessary
to insure the child of a freedom from scurvy, is small,
ranging from one-half to one ounce of strained juice daily,
this amount is increased gradually until the child is taking
from one and one-half to two ounces each day. It has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
found advisable to administer the fruit juice between the
two morning feedings. As a rule, the fruit juices are given
at the beginning of the seventh month, but they may be
given at a much earlier date, the time being adjusted by
the physician.</p>


<h3>RICKETS</h3>

<p>Rickets, like scurvy, is being discussed by scientists both
in America and abroad. The disease is widespread, particularly
in its subacute form, and its effect upon the
health of the child is so serious that no amount of effort
to prevent its development should be considered too great.</p>

<p><strong>Calcium Retention in Rickets.</strong>&mdash;The disease is characterized
by a failure of the bones to lay down lime salts,
this failure causes a softness and flexibility in the structure
of the bones which permits them to bend into deformities.
Then, too, it is a well established fact that any interference
with the calcium metabolism in the body, will inevitably
bring about disaster. (See Mineral Metabolism,
page <a href="#Page_185">185</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Factors Inducing Rickets.</strong>&mdash;According to Dr. Eddy,
&ldquo;It is impossible at present to determine whether rickets is
a true avitaminose or a consequence of deficiency in a
series of factors.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Treatment.</strong>&mdash;For breast-fed babies it is necessary to
adjust the diet of the mother to include more of the vitamine
bearing foods, since milk contains vitamines only in
proportion to the amount eaten in food. For artificially
fed children, the giving of cod liver oil has recently been
adopted as the surest and safest method of curing and preventing
the development of the disease. Like treatment
is used with breast-fed infants if the need arises.</p>

<p>The value of cod liver oil in this respect has only been
recently recognized. Mellanby of England claims that the
oil owes its curative and preventive properties to the presence
of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; vitamine. But scientists in this country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
have not fully accepted this view. Eddy states, &ldquo;It may be
that the power of the oil is due to its &lsquo;A&rsquo; vitamine content,
in which it is known to be rich, or it may be due to a new
vitamine, but the fact that the oil is a preventive in this
respect gives the pediatrist another agent to insure normal
growth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Sunshine as a Factor.</strong>&mdash;It has been found that the disease
rickets is more prevalent in winter than in summer;
this is believed to be due to the fact that sunshine during
the summer months exerts a distinctly beneficial influence
over the disease. Dr. Hess&rsquo;s report of the good results which
he has found to be derived from the use of the ultra violet
rays as a substitute for sunshine in winter, would seem to
confirm this view.</p>


<h3>MALNUTRITION</h3>

<p><strong>Malnutrition</strong> is not confined to the children of the poor,
though it is more common with infants of parents who have
not the means to secure the best milk and give them the
benefit of wholesome surroundings and plenty of sunshine.
But babies of people in moderate circumstances, and even
of wealthy parentage, are at times badly nourished, and require
the same exacting care, the same attention to the
food, the fresh air, and the sunshine that the poorer babies
need in order to survive. Malnutrition may be the result
of insufficient food, and it may also be due to the lack of
one definite food element. Again, it may be brought on by
some deformity of the mouth or stomach, which make it
impossible for the baby to get all the food which he requires
for his maintenance and growth. He may be born prematurely
and his digestive apparatus not be sufficiently developed
to care for the amount or type of food necessary for
his needs, or he may have some congenital weakness which
interferes with the absorption and assimilation of his food.
All of these points must be considered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
<strong>Evidences of Correct Feeding.</strong>&mdash;If the baby shows a
steady gain, both in weight and growth of stature, without
digestional disturbances, the food given him is probably correct,
but it must be kept in mind that nutritional disturbances,
such as rickets and scurvy, are slow in developing,
and do not manifest themselves with anything like the
rapidity of digestional disturbances. Hence the nurse must
take care as far as she is able, not only to prevent the food
from causing indigestion, but also to see that it is not given
in such a form as to induce those graver and more lasting
nutritional disturbances which affect the entire system from
infancy throughout the life of the individual.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p><strong>Breast Feeding versus Artificial Feeding.</strong>&mdash;There is
no doubt about the fact that the breast-fed baby suffers less
from digestional disturbances and has more resistance to
disease than the baby fed even upon a perfectly prepared
artificial food. The majority of diseases manifested by artificially
fed infants have their origin in the following errors
in diet.</p>

<p><strong>Over-Feeding.</strong>&mdash;Resulting in acute gastro-intestinal
disturbances (colic, enterocolitis, colitis, constipation).</p>

<p><strong>Under-Feeding.</strong>&mdash;Resulting in chronic, and acute
deficiency diseases (scurvy, rickets, malnutrition).</p>

<p><strong>Evidences of Dietetic Errors.</strong>&mdash;The stools, showing
characteristic evidences of excessive quantities of, protein,
fat, or carbohydrates in the formula. Loss of weight or failure
to gain. The development of deficiency diseases
(scurvy, rickets, xerophthalmia, rickets and malnutrition).</p>

<p><strong>Evidences of Correctness in Feeding.</strong>&mdash;Normal gain,
freedom from gastro-intestinal disturbances, and deficiency
diseases. Rosy cheeks, bright eyes, and a vigorous body.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment in Abnormal Conditions.</strong>&mdash;The treatment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
consists in adjusting the diet to meet the needs of the
particular disturbance manifested. Plenty of fresh air, sunshine
and sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Relapse.</strong>&mdash;One danger which the nurse must always be
on the lookout for is the relapse into the acute stage. The
diet is the chief treatment. In acute gastro-intestinal disturbances
rest from food is essential for at least twenty-four
hours. Some infants can easily endure starvation for
this short period. However, when malnutrition has already
been established, it is not wise to carry out the starvation
treatment over-long. A cautious return to a normal diet
may be made as soon as acute symptoms disappear.</p>

<p><strong>Fevers in General.</strong>&mdash;It requires very little deviation
from the normal to raise the temperature of a child. A
slight attack of indigestion, a slight soreness of the throat,
will bring up the temperature of some children out of all
proportion to the seriousness of the disorder.</p>

<p><strong>Diet in Fevers of Short Duration.</strong>&mdash;As a rule, in the
fevers of short duration, such as intermittent fever, malarial
fever, etc., the diet is a simple matter. Milk is given when
it agrees, with buttermilk, koumiss, broths, and albuminized
beverages to vary the diet.</p>

<p><strong>Diet in Infectious Diseases.</strong>&mdash;When, however, the fever
is induced by specific bacteria, such as in the case of typhoid
and scarlet fever, the diet is a different matter altogether.
The disease may be one in which the diet is the chief item
of importance; such is the case with typhoid and scarlet
fever, with the former because of its long duration, the
increased rate of metabolism due to both the fever and the
action of the bacteria making it necessary to increase the
normal amount of food to meet the new requirements of the
body; and with the latter on account of the kidney complications
which must be guarded against, and which can only
be handled by regulating the diet.</p>

<p><strong>Infant Feeding.</strong>&mdash;The feeding of infants under febrile
conditions resolves itself into an adjustment of the milk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244a" id="Page_244a">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244<i>a</i>]</a></span>
formula to meet the existing state of affairs. The digestion
is always more or less disturbed by fever, especially during
the early stages.</p>

<p><strong>Restricting the Food.</strong>&mdash;It is not always possible to diagnose
the disease immediately, so that the safe thing to do is
to lengthen the intervals between the feedings for the
breast-fed baby and to stop food entirely for twelve to
twenty-four hours for those who are artificially fed, when
there is any doubt as to the cause of the rise of temperature.
Some mothers find it difficult, if not impossible, to institute
this period of starvation. In these cases barley water or
albumen water may be given at stated intervals. Many
physicians give very weak tea, slightly sweetened, under the
above conditions; it does no harm to the baby and relieves
the mother from the belief that her child is being starved to
death. In twenty-four hours, if the fever arises from disturbed
digestion, some manifestation of the condition will
be observed.</p>

<p><strong>Bacterial Activity.</strong>&mdash;In cases of intestinal putrefaction
the fever is apt to rise at an alarming rate and is controlled
only by removing the cause. The proteins which have
escaped digestion and absorption in the intestines furnish
the best medium for the growth of putrefactive bacteria.
Hence this food constituent must be given in its most
digestible form.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;Milk in most instances is the best
form in which to give protein food, especially to young children
and babies. At times, however, it will be found that
milk disagrees; it must be peptonized, or one of the fermented
milks, such as buttermilk (Bulgarian culture),
Eiweissmilch, or koumiss must be substituted. In cases
where the putrefactive bacteria make it unwise to use milk
at all, for a time the proteins should be furnished in the
form of cereal gruels, and the juice of an orange strained
and diluted given once or twice a day between the morning
and evening feedings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244b" id="Page_244b">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244<i>b</i>]</a></span>
<strong>Whey</strong> is contraindicated in cases where the fever is
brought on by putrefaction in the intestine, chiefly because
it furnishes one of the best mediums known for the growth
of the offending bacteria.</p>

<p>Patience is required in handling the diet for fevers in
infancy. As has already been stated, it requires a very
slight cause to raise the temperature of a child, but for this
very reason especial care must be observed that no enlightening
symptom escapes the notice of the nurse.</p>

<p><strong>Complications.</strong>&mdash;Tuberculosis or scurvy may be in an
incipient stage, and may be overcome if recognized in time.
The nurse has a better opportunity for observing changes
in an infant or child under her care than the physician who
comes once a day or less. The nurse should make note of
these changes, that the physician may have a chance to
regulate the diet accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Fluid Diet.</strong>&mdash;With children, as with adults, the energy
output in fever is greater than in health, hence the need for
plenty of fluids to help eliminate the waste products due to
the increased metabolism. These fluids may consist of
water, fruit beverages, cereal water, whey, and broth. It is
well for the nurse to remember that when the child is confined
to bed, he will not need so much food as he would if
he were up and about, but that if the fever is of long duration,
as in typhoid, the increased rate of metabolism must
be met by an increased amount of food, as the ordinary
requirement standards for a child in health cannot be
applied to the diet of a child under these conditions.</p>


<h3>SCARLET FEVER</h3>

<p>Scarlet fever is an acute infectious disease, characterized
by high fever, sore throat, a red rash, and a tendency to
nephritis. The disease usually begins suddenly with an
attack of vomiting; the temperature rises to 104&deg; or 105&deg;
and on the first or second day a rash appears, first on the
chest and neck, and spreads over the entire body. This lasts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244c" id="Page_244c">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244<i>c</i>]</a></span>
from three to seven days, desquamation begins soon after
the rash disappears and lasts from two weeks to six, the
palms of the hands and soles of the feet peeling last. The
appearance of the tongue is very characteristic, being
coated, and through this coating are seen a few bright red
points, producing the well-known strawberry tongue. After
a few days the coating disappears, leaving the tongue bright
red. In mild cases the tonsils are enlarged and the throat
very red. In severe cases there may be difficulty in distinguishing
the disease from diphtheria without a culture
being taken. The tendency of the child to develop
nephritis during the second or third week makes the treatment
largely dietetic in character.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;Milk is the chief diet for the first
three weeks. If it disagrees, it should be modified or peptonized
to suit the condition. Koumiss and buttermilk
may be substituted when it is impossible to prepare the
milk so that it will not cause digestional disturbances. This,
however, is seldom found to be the case during infancy.
Malted milk and even condensed milk, or some of the dextrinized
and malted foods at times prove valuable when
whole milk disagrees. But the nurse must remember that
a baby runs a risk of developing nutritional diseases of a
grave character if fresh milk is eliminated from the diet for
any great length of time.</p>

<p>Older children may have plain vanilla ice cream and
plain junket, oyster or clam broth made with milk, the
oysters and clams carefully strained out. Lemonade and
orange juice may be given, but no meat broths or albumenized
beverages or egg dishes can be admitted to the
dietary.</p>

<p><strong>Development of Nephritis.</strong>&mdash;Nephritis must be guarded
against. The skin, being covered with a rash, is put out of
commission as an excretory organ; in consequence all of the
work of this description is placed upon the kidneys. In the
first part of this text the work of the kidneys was defined;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244d" id="Page_244d">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244<i>d</i>]</a></span>
it was found that they were the chief organs for the excretion
of the end-products of protein metabolism. It can be
readily understood that when these organs are given not
only their own work but that of the other organs to perform,
unless the food requiring the greatest amount of effort
on the part of the kidneys is confined to those types which
can be most easily taken care of, such as milk, the kidneys
stand a great chance of becoming impaired. Such is the
case in nephritis.</p>

<p><strong>Convalescent Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The return to normal diet
must be made with the greatest caution. Specimens of
urine must be taken often, for in this way alone can the
development of nephritis be reckoned with.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Should
nephritis develop in spite of efforts to prevent it, a farinaceous
diet<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> such as is given in these conditions must be
resorted to.</p>

<p>After three weeks, if the patient shows no disposition
toward nephritis, and if convalescence is progressing satisfactorily,
the diet may be increased day by day, adding milk
toast, cereals, cream soups, rice, baked potato, then custards
and soft eggs, the soft part of oysters, broiled or baked fish,
broiled breast of chicken, and, still later, rare beef and lamb
chops. Meat, however, must not be given until all danger
from nephritis has passed.</p>


<h3>DIPHTHERIA</h3>

<p><strong>Diphtheria.</strong>&mdash;The feeding in diphtheria follows the
r&eacute;gime given in acute fevers. The body must be kept in
good condition. At the same time it is necessary to understand
the complications which make the dietetic treatment
of this disease assume a place of importance.</p>

<p><strong>Complications.</strong>&mdash;It may be complicated by broncho-pneumonia,
albuminuria, carditis, endocarditis, and dilatation
of the heart. Anemia must be combated, but care should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244e" id="Page_244e">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244<i>e</i>]</a></span>
be used not to push the diet to such an extent as to impose
too great a tax upon the already weakened heart.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;While the fever lasts the diet must
be fluid, milk, buttermilk, malted milk, and some of the
proprietary infant foods such as Mellin&rsquo;s Food, Eskay&rsquo;s
Food, and like preparations. Milk gruels, made with milk
and some cereal such as farina, barley flour, fine cornmeal,
arrowroot, strained oatmeal, etc., are at times more easily
swallowed than the unthickened liquids. Liquid beef peptonoids,
panopeptone, and like predigested beef preparations
prove valuable in many cases.</p>

<p><strong>Convalescent Diet.</strong>&mdash;As convalescence progresses, or in
cases where the patient finds it easier to swallow a semi-solid
than a liquid, soft custards, gelatin, well-cooked
cereals, and ice cream may be given. Eggnog and milk
punch are at times given, but only upon the advice of the
physician in charge.</p>

<p><strong>Rectal Feeding.</strong>&mdash;When the condition of the patient
makes it necessary to nourish in other ways than by mouth,
nutrient enemas<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> may be given. In certain cases of diphtheria,
young infants can be fed more successfully through
a tube inserted by way of the nose into the stomach than
by feeding in the ordinary way. The formula is prepared
in the same way as for bottle feeding, and is poured into a
glass funnel and through the soft rubber catheter into the
stomach. Care must be observed to prevent the patient
struggling on account of the heart weakness which invariably
complicates this disease.</p>


<h3>WHOOPING COUGH</h3>

<p>In the early months of life it is probable that whooping
cough is one of, if not the most fatal of the diseases to which
the infant is subjected. The period of incubation of this
disease is from one to two weeks, the cough at first not
appearing different from those accompanying colds of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244f" id="Page_244f">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244<i>f</i>]</a></span>
sorts. However, in from ten days to two weeks the characteristic
whoop occurs, differentiating this disease from all
others. The symptoms aside from the whoop are the difficulty
of taking breath and the great prostration after the
paroxysm and the frequent vomiting of the food, brought
on by the violent coughing.</p>

<p>In very young infants the whoop does not always occur.
But the child coughs and holds its breath until it is blue in
the face. At times young babies may have convulsions.
The so-called spasmodic stage, during which the child may
have from a few to a great number of paroxysms of coughing
a day, lasts from a month to six weeks, and in some
cases even longer. As the disease declines the cough gradually
disappears and the child appears to be suffering with
ordinary bronchitis. The characteristic whoop may return
at any time during the ensuing six months or year if the
child has an attack of bronchitis and is inclined to cough.</p>

<p><strong>Complications and After-effects.</strong>&mdash;The complications
and after-effects of whooping cough give it a serious character.
Hemorrhage may occur from the nose. According
to Ruhr&auml;h: &ldquo;Paralysis may follow from meningeal hemorrhage,
broncho-pneumonia, acute emphysema, and collapse
of the lung may occur. Diarrhea, convulsions, and albuminuria
are also met with. Tuberculosis and chronic bronchitis
may follow.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The diet plays an important part
in whooping cough. The serious complications and after-effects
of this disease upon children necessitate a rigid observance
of dietary laws. With infants it is always best,
when it is possible, to give breast milk. As this is the
natural food it requires less effort on the part of the digestive
apparatus to become available. It has been proved
that even during the time when the baby is nursing the
milk is projected in spurts into the duodenum without waiting
to be attacked by digestive enzymes in the stomach, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244g" id="Page_244g">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244<i>g</i>]</a></span>
for this reason the breast-fed infant is more apt to be efficiently
nourished than the artificially fed baby, who loses his
dinner by vomiting before absorption has had a chance
to occur.</p>

<p><strong>Diet under Ten Years of Age.</strong>&mdash;For children under ten
years, a fluid diet is necessary, at least in the beginning of
the disease while there is a fever, and later, if the vomiting
is persistent. Milk, buttermilk, koumiss, broths, albuminized
beverages, and cereal gruels such as barley and oatmeal
gruel and arrowroot gruel can be given. Later, if the fluids
are retained, cream of wheat, farina, junket, soft custards,
and soft-cooked eggs may be added. Care must be taken in
giving toast, unless it is softened with milk or broth, for
the crumbs may bring on a paroxysm of coughing and vomiting.
The best results in feeding with whooping cough are
obtained by giving the food in small quantities and oftener.
A few ounces given every two hours are less apt to be vomited
than a larger quantity. It is also easier for the child
to take the small amount after an attack of coughing and
vomiting than it would be for him to attempt a larger meal.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Stimulants.</strong>&mdash;In many cases where weakness is
great, it has been found advisable to add some stimulant to
the diet. With infants this is best given in albumen water,
a small amount of good brandy acting better than other
stimulants. With young children some of the predigested
liquid beef preparations, such as liquid peptonoids, are
found valuable. These foods are given alternately with the
other fluid foods.</p>

<p><strong>Hygiene and Sanitation.</strong>&mdash;Infants and children suffering
with whooping cough require plenty of fresh air and sunshine.
They must be kept out of doors as much as possible
and sleep in well-ventilated rooms or sleeping porches.
They must be protected from drafts and excitement, and
never allowed to become over-tired. In this way the anemia
which so often results from prolonged attacks of whooping
cough is in a measure held in check. At times it is found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244h" id="Page_244h">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244<i>h</i>]</a></span>
necessary to give some kind of an iron tonic, but this comes
under the jurisdiction of the physician instead of the nurse.
When bad effects do occur in spite of all the care exercised
during the attack of whooping cough, they must be accorded
the treatment especially devised to meet the situation.</p>


<h3>MEASLES</h3>

<p>This is an acute, infectious disease characterized by a red
eruption which appears on the fourth day. Measles is one
of the most contagious of all the diseases of childhood. It
may be acquired by direct contact with another case or by
being in the room with a case. The infection may also be
carried through the air and occasionally by a third person.
Measles is more prevalent in the winter than in summer.
In cities it often occurs in epidemics. The period of incubation
is from ten days to three weeks, occurring generally at
about two weeks after exposure.</p>

<p>The attack may begin with the child showing a languid
attitude, complaining of headache. Then a cough develops,
with nausea and fever at times. The fever is often high,
reaching 104&deg; F. on the second day. As a rule the fever
gradually falls after the second day and becomes normal in
almost a week. However, the temperature varies in different
cases.</p>

<p><strong>Complications.</strong>&mdash;Measles is not considered dangerous in
itself, but the after-effects sometimes prove fatal. This is
especially the case in broncho-pneumonia, which frequently
develops during or after the attack.</p>

<p>The gastro-intestinal, as well as the respiratory, tract is
attacked in measles, diarrhea being especially common.
Very weak children have been known to develop gangrenous
stomatitis; paralysis and tuberculosis<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> likewise develop in
some cases as the direct result of measles.</p>

<p>Thus it is demonstrated that measles is not to be lightly
treated. Even if it is not in itself fatal, the results of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244i" id="Page_244i">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244<i>i</i>]</a></span>
disease are so dangerous that the care of the nurse is especially
necessary. The great trouble is that so often a nurse
is not in attendance and the child suffers through ignorance
of the mother.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The dietetic treatment of measles
is important. For infants milk is the exclusive diet, the
formula for bottle-fed babies having to be weakened on
account of the catarrhal condition of the gastro-intestinal
tract. For older children it is necessary to confine the diet
to fluids as long as the fever lasts, and at times longer if the
stomach gives evidence of digestional disturbances. Milk
is the chief food, with milk soups, buttermilk, and koumiss
used to vary the diet. Orangeade and lemonade may be
given to allay thirst. A return to normal diet must be made
gradually, giving cereal gruels, milk toast, and broth before
the more solid articles of diet suitable to the age of the
child. When there are complications they must be treated,
as in whooping cough, according to their symptoms.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p><strong>Gastro-intestinal Disturbances</strong> are responsible for much
of the fever manifested during infancy and childhood.</p>

<p><strong>Infectious Diseases</strong> are all more or less accompanied by
an elevation of temperature.</p>

<p><strong>Incipient Diseases</strong>, especially tuberculosis and scurvy,
may likewise cause a rise of temperature. The relief of
either disease or the fever depends largely upon how quickly
the conditions are discovered and the means instituted to
overcome them.</p>

<p><strong>Metabolism in Febrile Conditions</strong> of children, as well as
of adults, is rapidly increased, hence the energy output is
greater, and for this reason the fluid intake must be augmented
in order to eliminate the toxic substances produced
as a result of the rapid breaking down of the body tissues.</p>

<p><strong>The Kidneys</strong> are more or less strained to eliminate the
products of the increased metabolism and for this reason it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244j" id="Page_244j">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244<i>j</i>]</a></span>
is especially necessary to adjust the diet in order to limit,
as far as possible, the foods which add to the burden already
imposed upon the organs of excretion.</p>

<p><strong>The Skin</strong> is an organ of excretion which, under normal
conditions, shares the work of the kidneys. In infectious
conditions, accompanied by eruptions which more or less
cover the entire surface of the body, this organ is temporarily
out of commission, hence its work, as well as their
own, must be accomplished by the kidneys.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment</strong> in the majority of infectious diseases
may be divided into three periods: Starvation, Fluid Diet,
and Convalescent Diet.</p>

<p>Starvation, during which time no food is given for
twenty-four hours or longer, in order to allow the digestive
apparatus to rest and to give time for any substance which
may be causing the elevation of the temperature to pass
from the body. This treatment is also wise because it furnishes
an opportunity for the symptoms of the disease to
manifest themselves; Fluid Diet, given when acute symptoms
subside, and Convalescent Diet when danger from
relapse is over.</p>

<p><strong>Scarlet Fever</strong> is treated with two main ideas in view&mdash;preventing
the development of nephritis and relieving the
condition should it develop.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment</strong> is logically the only means of treating
or relieving nephritis. For the first three weeks, during which
time this complication is apt to develop, a milk diet is necessary.
This may be in the form of whole milk, milk soups,
malted milk, etc. At the end of this time, if there are still
no symptoms of nephritis, a convalescent diet, beginning
with cereals and soft toast and progressing through the simple
digestible foods such as rice, baked potatoes, soft eggs,
etc., may be given. This is continued until the patient is
well on the road to recovery. Meat should not be added
until practically all danger of nephritis is passed.</p>

<p><strong>Nephritis.</strong>&mdash;If, during the course of the disease this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244k" id="Page_244k">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244<i>k</i>]</a></span>
complication, should develop, the treatment described for acute
nephritis on page 336 should be immediately instituted.</p>

<p><strong>Diphtheria.</strong>&mdash;Dangerous complications at times develop
as a result of diphtheria, making the treatment of this disease
of the utmost importance. Heart symptoms, pneumonia,
albuminuria, and anemia are among the complications
to be dreaded and combated.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment</strong> in diphtheria is most important. It
consists of a fluid diet made up of milk, malted milk, or
buttermilk. At times the condition of the throat makes a
slightly thickened mixture more easily swallowed than one
which is distinctly fluid in character, and for this purpose
farina, arrowroot, or barley flour may be used.</p>

<p><strong>Increasing the Diet.</strong>&mdash;As convalescence advances the
semi-solids, soft toast, soft custards, gelatin, and cereals
may be given. Should the heart show symptoms of being
affected, the intake of fluid must be restricted.</p>

<p><strong>Gavage and Rectal Feeding</strong> are at times necessary. Infants
may be successfully fed by passing a small rubber tube
through the nose into the stomach and administering the
milk formula to which they are accustomed. Rectal feeding
is likewise valuable in cases of extreme anemia accompanying
diphtheria.</p>

<p>Care must be observed by the nurse in giving gavage to
babies, since any struggling on the part of the child may
result in death from heart disease.</p>

<p><strong>Whooping Cough.</strong>&mdash;On account of the character of the
disease and the proneness of the stomach to eject the food
during paroxysms of coughing, dietary measures are more
or less necessary in order to enable the child to receive sufficient
food to cover his daily needs.</p>

<p><strong>Complications.</strong>&mdash;Hemorrhage, pneumonia, albuminuria,
diarrhea, and convulsions may occur during the disease,
while tuberculosis and chronic bronchitis may follow as
after-effects.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;Breast milk is by far the best food
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244l" id="Page_244l">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244<i>l</i>]</a></span>
for the baby, in this as in all conditions. In whooping cough
the fact that this fluid leaves the stomach almost as soon as
it enters lessens the chances of the baby losing its meal by
vomiting it.</p>

<p><strong>Older children</strong> do well with frequent small meals, since
they are not so apt to give rise to pressure which brings on
the paroxysms of coughing and vomiting. When the meal
is vomited, a second should be given in order to keep the
child from suffering from malnutrition.</p>

<p><strong>Stimulation</strong> is found to be necessary in certain cases. Albumen
water containing a spoonful of brandy or some of the
prepared beef preparations, such as liquid peptonoids, may
prove valuable under the circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Measles.</strong>&mdash;Complications and after-effects developing
as a result of measles make the dietetic treatment of this
disease important. Gastro-intestinal disturbances, especially
diarrhea, are apt to occur, and tuberculosis has been
known to develop as a result of measles.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The fluid diet as used in any acute
febrile condition is used as long as the temperature is elevated.
Milk, buttermilk, malted milk, and milk soups constitute
the chief items in the diet. Orangeade and lemonade

<br />
THE FEEDING OF ADULTS IN DISEASES OF THE
GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRACT</h2>

<h3>ACUTE AND CHRONIC GASTRITIS</h3>


<p><strong>Predisposing Factors.</strong>&mdash;The majority of diseases affecting
the stomach have as their predisposing factors, and
owe their development to, one or all of the following conditions:
(1) errors in diet; (2) disturbed secretory processes;
(3) disturbed motility and tone.</p>

<p>It is probable that in the beginning the first factor was
the chief offender in the case, bringing about the development
of one or both of the other conditions. The other
factors to be considered in this respect are heredity, occupation,
poverty, and diseases which involve to a greater or
lesser degree the digestion of the stomach and intestines.
A child may inherit a weakened organism through excesses or
disease on the part of the parent. If this weakness is not
overcome while the child is growing, the probabilities are
that the digestion steadily declines until in adult life it becomes
a pathological condition. Lack of fresh air, poor
and dirty food, unwholesome surroundings, crowded and
badly ventilated sleeping rooms, insufficient water, and
overwork, all act in making the digestion bad. These must
be overcome if permanent good is to result.</p>

<p><strong>Errors in Diet.</strong>&mdash;Errors in diet arise more often through
ignorance than from any other cause. A child may be
allowed to eat any and all kinds of unwholesome and unsuitable
food. When the stomach rebels, showing the serious
danger signals of nature, medicines are given but the diet
is unheeded, until the time comes when even the medicines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
fail to give temporary relief, and the organs of digestion are
in some instances permanently impaired.</p>

<p><strong>Disturbed Secretory Processes.</strong>&mdash;Consensus of opinion
goes to show that the majority of cases of acute and
chronic gastritis (catarrhal) and gastric ulceration are due
primarily to a disturbance of the secretory processes, while
the impaired motility and lack of tone in the stomach probably
influence their development and aggravate the disease
already present.</p>

<p><strong>Composition of Gastric Juice.</strong>&mdash;In a former chapter
the processes of gastric digestion were explained. The gastric
juice, composed of from 0.2 to 0.3% free hydrochloric
acid and several important enzymes and lipases, which act
upon the proteins and emulsified fats, must be sufficient in
quantity to assure good digestion, and when anything arises
to interfere with the secretion of this fluid a deviation from
the normal is bound to occur.</p>

<p><strong>Disturbed Motility and Tone.</strong>&mdash;Again, it has been
proved that good gastric digestion, like good intestinal digestion,
depends more or less upon the way in which the
food mass is mixed with the digestive juices and moved
along the alimentary canal. Anything which interferes
with the secretion of the juices or delays the food over its
normal length of time in the stomach surely exerts unfavorable
influences on the general metabolism of the food, for
while, as we have already found, gastric digestion is not
essential to the final utilization of the food in health, in disease
it undoubtedly exerts a marked influence upon the general
nutrition of the individual.</p>


<h3>HYPOCHLORHYDRIA</h3>

<p>The lack of hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice lowers
the resistance to bacterial action, for this constituent exerts
a decided germicidal influence in gastric digestion, preventing
fermentation with the production of organic acids and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
probably alcohol. In conditions due to hypochlorhydria
(lack of hydrochloric acid) foods which leave the stomach
quickly must be given with enough of the other necessary
constituents in their simplest and most easily digested form
to balance the diet and prevent the occurrence of the other
disorders as troublesome as the original disorder.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The following points must be
kept in mind in formulating a dietary for patients suffering
from a deficiency of hydrochloric acid: (1) boil the drinking
water to destroy any bacteria which may be present; (2)
use carbohydrates in the form of starch rather than sugar,
since starch is less liable to fermentation from bacteria
than sugar; (3) limit the foods which delay the passage
of the food mass from the stomach; fats pass into the
duodenum more slowly than other foods and when fed with
other foods delay their passage materially; (4) avoid the
use of soda bicarbonate, as it tends to reduce the normal
acid content of the stomach, thus preventing its germicidal
action upon the fermentative bacilli; alkaline carbonates
likewise inhibit the flow of gastric juices; (5) give especial
attention to the attractiveness of the food served; let it be
appetizing and savory, for by such means is the appetite
juice and incidentally an increased flow of the gastric juices
stimulated; (6) condiments and spices, meat broths high
in extractives, and salt foods such as caviar and endives may
be given at the discretion of the physician; it is seldom advisable
to give the foods which are indigestible, even when
they act as stimulants to the secretory cells of the stomach.</p>


<h3>HYPERCHLORHYDRIA</h3>

<p class="center">(Excess secretion of acid in the stomach)</p>

<p><strong>The Effect of Excess Acid.</strong>&mdash;An excessive flow of
hydrochloric acid has been found to be the cause of much
of the acute and chronic gastritis, in fact more of the cases
are traceable to an excess than to a lack of hydrochloric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
acid. This acid is more or less irritating in character, and
the tender mucous membranes lining the gastric organ
being constantly bathed in a secretion composed chiefly of
acid must necessarily in time suffer a certain amount of
irritation and inflammation, causing the development of a
pathological condition which may be temporary or permanent,
that is, it may result in acute or chronic gastritis,
according to the amount of acid secreted and the length of
time the hypersecretion is allowed to continue.</p>

<p><strong>Determining the Acid Content of Stomach.</strong>&mdash;The difference
between the cases brought about by an excess flow
of hydrochloric acid are more or less difficult to distinguish
from those caused by a lack of this constituent in the gastric
juice, chiefly because in the latter case the organic acids
formed as the result of bacterial action upon the food exert
an equally irritating effect upon the membranes of the
stomach, and the only sure method of determining the cause
of the disturbance is by an analysis of the stomach contents,
by which means the percentage of hydrochloric acid
is determined.</p>

<p><strong>Lavage.</strong>&mdash;It has been found advisable, in some cases of
acute gastritis which do not yield readily to rest and liquid
diet, to wash the stomach and allow a certain period of rest
before giving any food; in this way the organ is rid of all
of the offending material and thus has a better chance of a
quick recovery.</p>


<h3>ACUTE GASTRITIS</h3>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The following dietetic treatment
for acute gastritis is advised: As the stomach is the chief
seat of disturbance, all unnecessary work must be taken
from this region for a certain period:</p>

<p>(1) That any obscure cause may manifest itself and
the diagnosis may be rendered more accurately and more
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
(2) That by resting the organ the offending materials
may pass out of the body and thus prevent further trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Starvation Period.</strong>&mdash;Twenty-four hours of total abstinence
from food may seem extreme, but as a rule in
acute cases of gastritis it is the only sane and safe method
of instituting a diet and thus beginning to overcome the
cause of the disturbance. After the period of starvation
the diet is begun with caution.</p>

<p><strong>Fluid Diet.</strong>&mdash;Fluids should be given first in the form of
well-skimmed broths, which may be re&euml;nforced with egg or
cereal flours when the patient is very thin or anemic. Buttermilk,
made with the Bulgarian cultures, koumiss and
other fermented milk foods, liquid beef preparations such as
peptonoids or panopepton, albumenized orange juice, cereal
gruels treated with Taka diastase when it is found necessary,
and peptonized milk. These may be given in from four to
six ounces at a time, every two hours on the second day.</p>

<p><strong>Increasing the Diet.</strong>&mdash;On the third day if the attack is
slight the diet may be increased by adding toast, softened
with peptonized milk, an ordinary serving (3 ounces) of
farina, cream of wheat or rice, re&euml;nforced meat broth with
two crackers, a cup of tea and a slice of toast, and one or
two soft-cooked eggs. If the acute symptoms are still
present on the third day, the diet advised for the second day
must be continued until they disappear.</p>

<p><strong>Convalescent Diet.</strong>&mdash;On the fifth day, if progress is
satisfactory, lightly broiled chicken or a small piece of rare
broiled beefsteak may be added to the diet and the meals
reduced in number from six to four.</p>

<p><strong>Relapse.</strong>&mdash;The patient must be warned against overeating
or eating any of the articles which are known to
cause an acute attack in his individual case, since one attack
predisposes to another, and chronic gastritis may develop
as the result of the continual gastric disturbance.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHRONIC GASTRITIS</h3>

<p>The treatment in chronic gastritis is very like that in
the more acute form; that is, it must be combated by
removing the cause. Lack of fresh air and exercise have
much to do with the development of chronic gastritis, but
even they combined with a judicious amount of rest would
be wasted without a proper adjustment of the diet to
cover the main points of the disturbance. As has already
been mentioned, the cause may be a lack of gastric juice or
it may be an excess of it; it may be intensified by an <strong>atonic</strong>
condition of the organ or from the food passing too quickly
into the duodenum.</p>

<p><strong>Test Meals.</strong>&mdash;As a rule it is not safe to make a snap
diagnosis as to the cause of this disorder. Since in many
instances the more serious disorders may be traced to a disregard
for nature&rsquo;s danger signals, the physician as a rule
advises a test meal, this meal consisting of a glass and a
half of water or a cup or two of tea without cream or sugar
and from one to two slices of toast or water rolls. In from
three-fourths to one hour or longer this is removed from the
stomach by means of a stomach pump and analyzed, the
result of the chemical and bacterial analyses forming the
basis for diagnosis. This meal is generally given in the
morning before any other food has been eaten.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The foods constituting the diet
in chronic gastritis must be of the simplest character and
prepared in the simplest manner. No fried foods are permissible.
Pastries, griddle cakes, rich puddings and sauces,
candies, and alcoholic beverages must be omitted from the
diet as well as the following articles of food: pork, veal, shellfish
except oysters, sardines, canned meats and canned fish,
highly seasoned and spiced dishes, twice-cooked meats, vinegar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
pickles, olives, cold slaw, pickled beets, catsup, mustard,
coarse fibered vegetables such as cabbage, old onions, old
turnips, and cucumbers, strong tea, coffee, or chocolate, rich
cream or dishes made entirely of cream. In cases of excessive
acidity due to a hypersecretion of HCl the extractives
of meat are contraindicated, hence all gravies and outside
parts of roasted meat must be omitted or limited in the
diet.</p>


<h3>GASTRIC ULCERATION</h3>

<p>Gastric ulcer may develop without an apparent cause.
As a rule, however, it manifests itself in individuals between
the years of fifteen and forty, particularly after prolonged
digestional disturbances, especially those accompanied
by a hypersecretion of acid. As the disease progresses,
anemia is more or loss severe, adding difficulty to
the feeding problem. Many of the symptoms are like those
of chronic gastritis, such as pain. However, the character
of this pain may be different, beginning soon after eating
and radiating toward the back. This point may be affected
by position. As a rule there is a tenderness over the seat
of the ulcer. This is detected by palpation. Vomiting is
one of the most general symptoms in gastric ulceration.
This may begin from one to two hours after eating when
the pain is at its height, or it may start as soon as food
enters the stomach. As a rule the latter condition is found
more often in very nervous women whose mental attitude
affects the stomach to such an extent as to make it difficult
to give them sufficient food to nourish them.</p>

<p><strong>Hemorrhage.</strong>&mdash;Hemorrhage occurs in about half of
the cases. The bleeding may be profuse and the blood
bright red, or it may be less severe and the color of the
blood changed by contact with the gastric juices to a dark
brown like coffee grounds.</p>

<p><strong>Excess Acid.</strong>&mdash;Hyperacidity is present in the majority
of the cases, the percentage of HCl rising at times fifty per
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
cent. or more. Other cases occur in which all of the just
mentioned symptoms except dyspepsia are missing, the first
intimation of the ulcer being hemorrhage or perforation.</p>

<p>The patient with gastric ulcer may recover entirely and
never have a return of the trouble, but care and close attention
are necessary, since the ulcers are apt to recur, at times
a series of ulcers developing one after another. Death may
occur from exhaustion or from perforation and peritonitis.
Surgical intervention is as a rule necessary when the ulcers
persist, as they generally develop at or near the pyloric
opening; and the constant development of cicatricial tissue
brings about an obstruction of the pylorus, which if not
relieved would allow the patient to starve.</p>

<p><strong>Diet Treatment.</strong>&mdash;There are a number of treatments
used in overcoming this condition. After the test meal and
the diagnosis, the patient is placed upon a diet directed to
overcome the chief symptom; for example, if the ulcer developed
as a result of hyperacidity, the diet would be
directed toward the relieving of that symptom. Boas<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
divides the treatment into three stages: (1) hemorrhage;
(2) the intermediate stage; (3) the convalescent stage.</p>

<p><strong>Starvation Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The majority of physicians
institute a total abstinence period for the first stage, allowing
no food or water to be taken by mouth. If the patient
is very weak and anemic from the extended course of the
disease, nutrient enemas are given from four to six times
a day, alternating with saline enemas. This total abstinence
continues from three to six days. Some cases have
been known to be fed in this way for a month or six weeks
with obvious success. However, this is not the rule but the
exception. The diet must be adjusted to the needs of each
individual, but a few general rules may be found helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;Milk is the food generally utilized
in the beginning. This may require peptonizing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
be digested, or it may have to be modified with limewater.
Protein foods require HCl for their digestion. If these
foods are fed they will absorb some of the excess acid, and
in this way save the already irritated wall of the organ
from additional irritation. When protein foods are given
they must be in the form of soft-cooked eggs, scraped raw
beef or beef juice, milk soups, and like protein foods.</p>

<p>When there is a dilatation of the organ there is more or
less danger of fermentation taking place, with the formation
of organic acids. These acids are exceedingly irritating,
and every care must be observed to prevent their production.
The following dietetic r&eacute;gime may be used as a guide
in many cases of gastric ulceration:</p>

<p><strong>Milk Diet.</strong>&mdash;&frac12; glass (4 ounces) of milk peptonized at
115&deg; F. for 20 minutes, every hour for three or four days.
After this the interval between feedings is lengthened to
two hours and the amount of milk increased to &frac34; of a
glass (6 ounces). This is continued from a week to ten
days. The patient may be given a cup of well-strained meat
broth, re&euml;nforced with an egg, once or twice a day, to vary
the monotony of the diet. During the third week the milk
may be given in the form of milk soups. These may be
slightly thickened with barley, rice, or farina flour. The
soups may be flavored with beef extract, but only a small
quantity must be used, owing to the stimulating properties
of these substances.</p>

<p><strong>Water as a Stimulus to Gastric Secretion.</strong>&mdash;Water is
exceedingly stimulating to the acid secreting cells of the
stomach, hence it is advisable to limit the amount of water
taken by mouth, allowing the patient just enough to wash
out the mouth without swallowing any. The thirst is relieved
by saline enemas.</p>

<p>It has been found, in many cases of gastric ulceration,
especially those accompanied by hemorrhage, that glucose
gives better results when used in rectal alimentation, than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
any other substance. The strength of the solution varies
from a five to a twenty-five per cent. solution. The number
of glucose enemas given each day must be regulated by the
physician. The method used is the same as in other rectal
feedings, the enema is given &ldquo;high,&rdquo; and the flow regulated
(drip-method).</p>

<p><strong>Convalescent Diet.</strong>&mdash;During the fourth week, if the
pain and discomfort are decreasing, soft-cooked or creamed
eggs may be added to the diet, together with thoroughly
boiled rice, farina, cream of wheat, wheatena and other
finely ground wheat foods, wine or fruit jelly, sweetened
slightly, or by using a small amount of saccharin for the
purpose, junket and plain vanilla ice cream. At the end
of the fourth week a very small portion of meat may be
given once a day. It may be scraped raw beef spread upon
toast or zwieback, or very lightly broiled beefsteak, broiled
lamb chop or chicken (breast only), or boiled or broiled
sweetbreads or brains. Spinach or green peas pressed
through a sieve are the first vegetables allowed. After these
young tender carrots and string beans may be given. Tea,
coffee, and chocolate are eliminated from the diet. Milk
flavored with coffee or cocoa may serve as a hot drink in
the morning when the desire or need for such a drink is
manifested. Butter is the best form of fat to be used in
cases of gastric ulceration, but this must be given with the
greatest caution. In cases where this fat is used in the
form of cream, the amount must be cut down or entirely
abandoned when there are evidences of butyric fermentation.
Buttermilk, koumiss, and other fermented milk drinks
are often found very satisfactory adjuncts to the diet.
These may be given between meals, or at meals they may
be substituted entirely for the milk when other foods are
being given. They are not sufficiently nourishing to take
the place of the milk diet otherwise. Albumenized orange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
juice and cream, egg and vichy may be given to add variety
to the diet.</p>

<p><strong>Anemia.</strong>&mdash;When anemia is severe, as is often the case
in gastric ulceration, the diet must be re&euml;nforced to overcome
it. Some of the concentrated milk foods such as
plasmon, encasin, sanatogen, etc., as well as the predigested
meat foods, such as panopepton, liquid beef peptonoids, and
like preparations, may be used to re&euml;nforce the diet.</p>

<p><strong>Bland Diet.</strong>&mdash;In certain cases of gastric ulceration it
has been found more advisable to use what is known as a
bland diet. This consists of farinaceous foods such as
farina, arrowroot, cream of wheat, corn meal, wheatena,
malted breakfast foods cooked thoroughly and given in the
form of gruels, and some of the proprietary infant foods,
such as Mellin&rsquo;s Food, Eskay&rsquo;s Food, Racahout. These
foods may require the addition of Taka diastase to make
them more readily digested. They leave the stomach more
rapidly than any of the others, and for this reason will be
found to give less discomfort than the foods containing a
high percentage of protein and fat. This diet, however, cannot
be prolonged on account of its lack of balance. If the
gruels are made with milk instead of with all water they
become more evenly balanced. Samples of the stomach
contents may be taken for analyses from time to time.</p>

<p><strong>Lavage.</strong>&mdash;When lavage is necessary the patient must
be allowed to rest after the process before being given food,
otherwise it is apt to be vomited.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions to Nurse.</strong>&mdash;The treatment for gastric
ulceration is thus seen to be strenuous. In the beginning
the patient is placed on a liquid or semi-solid diet, or is not
fed at all for a time. This is done that the diseased organ
may have a chance to adjust itself as far as possible and to
give the physician an opportunity of studying the changes
taking place in that organ. During the course of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
disease the general symptoms which develop from time to time,
causing more or less pain and discomfort to the patient, are
nervousness, which in some individuals amounts to melancholia,
extreme anemia and an utter distaste for food, all
of which require patience on the part of the physician, the
nurse, and the patient herself to overcome. The nurse must
see that the patient is not disturbed or made unhappy by
having business or home cares talked over in her presence;
she must be kept as cheerful and as comfortable as her condition
permits and urged to use care in her diet. After the
ulcer is healed, to prevent a return of the trouble she must
be warned against eating too fast or when over-tired, and
she must be advised against very hot and highly seasoned
foods, for, in the observance of these simple common-sense
precautions only is she even in a measure saved further
attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Special Diets Used for Gastric and Duodenal Ulcer.</strong>&mdash;There
are several well-known diets used in these conditions.
Among those that have been found most satisfactory may be
mentioned the Sippi diet, the Lenhartz diet.</p>

<p>All of these diets require the most careful adjustment as
to regulation of intervals of feeding, type of food material
used, and method of preparation and administration of
food.</p>

<p>The treatment is directed toward the reduction of the
free hydrochloric acid in the stomach in order that the ulcer
may have an opportunity for healing.</p>

<p><strong>Sippi Diet.</strong>&mdash;Equal quantities of heavy cream and
whole milk, beginning with &frac12; ounce each every hour during
the day. Alkaline powders are given with the meal
and one-half hour after the meal. These consist of 15
grains each of sodium bicarbonate and bismuth subcarbonate
with the feeding, and 10 grains of light oxide of
magnesia and 15 grains of sodium bicarbonate between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
feeding. The cream and milk are increased at the rate of
one-half ounce each at each feeding for two days, the
powders are continued as on the first day. On the fourth
day an egg is added to the diet, the milk and cream are
given in quantities of one and one-half ounce each, every
hour. On the fifth day two eggs are added. On the sixth
day one helping of oatmeal or other soft cereal is added
to the above diet. The diet is in this way increased until
the patient is taking three eggs and nine ounces of cooked
cereal each day in addition to the cream and milk mixture.
The amount given at one time must be small, never exceeding
six ounces (according to Carter, Howe and Mason).</p>

<p>An accurate control of the acidity of the stomach should
be maintained, this is accomplished by withdrawing a certain
amount of the gastric contents by means of the
stomach tube.</p>

<p><strong>The Lenhartz Diet.</strong>&mdash;This diet is likewise given in
hourly feedings, consisting of milk and raw eggs in the
beginning, then a small portion of sugar is added, next
scraped beef is added to the milk, eggs and sugar, already
given, then boiled rice. Next a small quantity of zwieback
(or soft toast), and continuing in this way, chicken, and butter
are admitted. In the beginning the quantity of milk is
100 c.c. and the number of eggs 2, given raw. It is served
iced, and with a teaspoon. When the sugar is added it is
beaten up with the eggs (20 gm.). The milk and eggs
are divided into separate feedings and given at hourly
intervals from 7 <small>A.M.</small> to 7 <small>P.M.</small> It is rarely possible to give
the amounts called for in the Lenhartz diet after the sixth
day, but as much as possible should be given without risking
an acute disturbance. Women, as a rule, find it more
difficult to take the full amount ordered than men.</p>

<p>The following outlines represent the diet for the first,
third, sixth, seventh and tenth day:</p>

<h3>GASTRIC CANCER</h3>

<p>As a rule the seat of the gastric cancer is the pylorus.
The patient gives evidence of chronic gastritis with continued
pain, localized tenderness, vomiting of partially digested
food and at times dilatation from extreme fermentation.
The hemorrhages are as a rule not large, the blood
having changed to a brownish color resembling coffee
grounds. Vomiting, in cases where the pylorus is involved,
generally occurs several hours after eating, the vomitus
being in an advanced state of fermentation. Upon analysis
of the stomach contents there is found to be a lack of free
HCl.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;In the dietetic treatment of
cancer of the stomach the most digestible forms of foods
must be given, milk forming in this, as in other gastric disorders,
the chief article of diet. As too much food cannot
be tolerated, the meals must be small, even if given more
frequently. The patient is often found to evince a distaste
for meat, in which case fish may be substituted. When
meat is given, it must be simple in form and preparation,
such as boiled or broiled sweetbreads or brains, scraped beef
or stewed chicken. Rice, farina, cornmeal mush, and other
fine cereals, cooked with or without milk, are valuable additions
to the diet. Well-cooked and strained spinach, green
peas, cauliflower, carrots, and tender string beans and
boiled or baked potatoes well mashed may be recommended.
Tea, coffee, or cocoa may be used to flavor the milk. These
must be given in small portions. The following diet list is
recommended by Friedenwald and Ruhr&auml;h:</p>

<h3>SUMMARY<br />
<br />
FACTORS INDUCING GASTRIC DISTURBANCES</h3>

<p>1. <strong>Errors in Diet.</strong>&mdash;Over-feeding, under-feeding, improper
food, unbalanced diet.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Disturbed Secretory Processes.</strong>&mdash;</p>

<p class="lists">(<i>a</i>) Over- or under-secretion of gastric juice.<br />
(<i>b</i>) An excess or deficiency of hydrochloric acid in the
juices.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Impaired Motility and Tone of the Gastric Organ.</strong>&mdash;The
peristaltic waves and muscular contraction of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
stomach walls becoming sluggish prevent the food mass from
passing into the intestines at a normal rate of speed, thus
giving rise to a fermentation of the food and a consequent
dilatation of the organ from the gas thus produced.</p>

<p><strong>Other Factors.</strong>&mdash;Lack of fresh air and exercise, indoor
occupation, bad hygiene, unsanitary surroundings, heredity,
certain diseases which are accompanied by gastric disorders.</p>

<p><strong>Diseases of Gastric Organ.</strong>&mdash;Acute and Chronic Gastritis,
Gastric-Ulceration, Gastric Cancer.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment.</strong>&mdash;Tests&mdash;Test meals, X-Ray examinations
(pictures and Fluoroscope). Patient is given no breakfast
on day of test. In X-Ray laboratory a bismuth or barium
meal is given, this meal consists of a pint of fluid, either
buttermilk or malted milk, into which a certain amount of
bismuth or barium chloride is mixed.</p>

<p><strong>Starvation Period.</strong>&mdash;A period of abstinence from food
is instituted in most of the gastric disorders, (<i>a</i>) to determine
the extent and character of the disease, (<i>b</i>) to rest
the digestive tract.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;Diet adjusted to meet the needs
of the individual case as determined by the medical examination.</p>

<p><strong>Instruction to Patient.</strong>&mdash;Individual warned against
overeating, drinking and constipation.</p>


<h3>PROBLEMS</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) Formulate a diet order for a patient suffering from
chronic gastritis. (Individual&rsquo;s food requirements must
be observed.)</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Formulate a diet for gastric ulceration. List the available
foods; the avoidable foods.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Outline a diet to be used in case of gastric cancer; show
how it differs from the one used in gastric ulceration.</p>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />
<br />
DISEASES OF THE INTESTINAL TRACT</h2>

<h3>ACUTE AND CHRONIC DIARRHEA (CATARRH), ENTEROCOLITIS,
DYSENTERY, CONSTIPATION, APPENDICITIS, CHRONIC CONSTIPATION,
AUTO-INTOXICATION</h3>


<p>Diarrhea, like gastritis, may be a symptom of many
diseases and a result of many digestional disturbances. Enteritis,
enterocolitis, dysentery, typhoid fever, and certain
cases of tuberculosis and syphilis are all accompanied by an
inflamed condition of the mucous lining of the intestinal
walls, and in each of these pathological conditions we may
find diarrhea as a resulting symptom.</p>

<p><strong>Causes.</strong>&mdash;Diarrhea may be acute or chronic in character.
It may be brought on by errors in diet, warm
weather, certain drugs, ptomaines, bad hygiene, polluted
water or milk, and by overeating. Idiosyncrasies against
certain kinds of food have been found in both adults and
children; these idiosyncrasies are manifested by pain and
diarrhea whenever the offending foods have been eaten.
Acute diarrhea has also been brought on in children by the
drinking of cold lemonade when over-heated.</p>

<p><strong>Diarrhea in Children.</strong>&mdash;All diarrheas in children, and
especially those developing during the hot months, must be
looked on with suspicion and given immediate attention
before they have an opportunity to develop serious features
which may terminate in death before the seriousness of
the condition is realized.</p>

<p>As a rule, almost any diarrhea in children will raise the
temperature. This does not occur so often with adults
unless the diarrhea results from infectious fevers, ptomaines,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
etc., in which case it may rise suddenly and to a considerable
height.</p>


<h3>ACUTE ENTERITIS (DIARRHEA)</h3>

<p><strong>The Bowels.</strong>&mdash;The symptoms of this condition are too
liquid or too frequent stools, the number varying from three
to twelve or more a day. They may be greenish yellow in
color and contain particles of undigested food and mucus.
In prolonged diarrheal attacks the stools sometimes contain
blood.</p>

<p>The attack may be accompanied by more or less pain
of a colicky nature, due to the formation of gas in the intestinal
tract. In ptomaine poisoning this pain is sometimes
very intense. As a rule the intestinal tract is emptied by
means of salt, oil, etc., but this is generally directed by the
physician. A soapsuds or salts and glycerin enema to
flush the colon will often give quick relief by dispelling the
gas.</p>

<p><strong>Starvation.</strong>&mdash;The entire digestive tract requires absolute
rest for a certain period; no food and very little water,
the latter in the form of bits of ice only, are given for a
period lasting from twelve to thirty-six hours or more, depending
upon the violence of the attack and the condition
of the patient. This is to allow the toxic substances which
are probably causing the disturbance to pass out of the
body, either in the feces or in the urine. When the acute
symptoms subside, that is, when the pain and distention
of the intestines have disappeared, and the bowel movements
become more normal in number and character, the
dietetic treatment suitable to the condition is instituted.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The first day the patient is given
a small cup of weak tea, half a glass of buttermilk or peptonized
milk, or a cup of well-skimmed meat broth, every
three or four hours. If the patient is weak, the nourishment
may be given oftener, and in those cases it is often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
found advisable to give a small amount of alcohol in the
form of brandy in albumen water, or panopepton or liquid
peptonoids. These may be administered in tablespoonful
doses every two hours. Whole milk, unless it is peptonized,
and at times even then, is not advisable in diarrheal conditions
on account of its liability to form curds which decompose
with the production of toxic substances, known to be
exceedingly irritating to the already inflamed mucous membranes
lining the intestinal walls.</p>

<p><strong>Increasing the Diet.</strong>&mdash;As the diarrhea and inflammation
subside, the following foods are gradually introduced
into the dietary, keeping in mind always that a return of
the acute symptoms is apt to occur. Hence the patient
must never be overfed. It is better to err on the side of
too little than too much food during the early convalescent
period.</p>

<p><strong>Diet.</strong>&mdash;Soft-cooked eggs, toast (slightly buttered),
cocoa made with water instead of milk, chicken, calf&rsquo;s-foot
or wine jelly; later, well-cooked rice, junket, and soft custard;
still later, lightly broiled beefsteak, lamb chops,
chicken, squab or quail, sweetbreads or brains. Not until
the patient is entirely free from all symptoms of diarrhea
or intestinal disturbance may the following foods be given:
cream or cream dishes such as cream toast, cream chicken,
or cream soup, raw or stewed fruit, green vegetables, salt
foods, spiced foods of any description; pastries, confectionery
and desserts in general, unless they are simple in character
and are sweetened with saccharin instead of sugar,
as the latter substance is particularly susceptible to fermentation.</p>

<p><strong>Anemia as a Result.</strong>&mdash;Anemia is one of the most common
results of prolonged diarrheal attacks, especially in
those toxic diarrheas resulting from infectious diseases,
dysentery, etc. The blood-making tissues suffer from a lack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
of nourishment and are in consequence incapable of producing
blood of the best quality. Hence the starvation
treatment cannot be carried on over a very extended period
or the resulting anemia may be more difficult to overcome
than the original trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Selecting and Regulating the Diet.</strong>&mdash;The following
points must be kept in view when regulating the diets of
individuals who are prone to develop diarrhea:</p>

<p><strong>Preparing the Diet.</strong>&mdash;Only such foods as are known to
agree with the individual, and these prepared in the simplest
manner possible, must have a place in the dietary.</p>

<p><strong>Fermentation.</strong>&mdash;All foods that are subject to fermentation
either in the stomach or intestines must be withheld,
at least until the attack is well over. Sugar is an example
of such foods; saccharin may be substituted when necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Avoidable Foods.</strong>&mdash;Pork, veal, and shellfish must be
left out of the dietary, possibly for months, since they have
been found frequently not only to bring about a return
attack of diarrhea but also to have been the cause of the
original one.</p>

<p>Fatty foods of all sorts had best be avoided as long as
there are symptoms of diarrhea; these foods are handled
with difficulty by the digestive apparatus and impose extra
work upon the intestine, which is already taxed by the
disease.</p>

<p><strong>Restricting Fluids.</strong>&mdash;Fluid foods should be more or
less limited in the diet, since they require more effort on
the part of the intestines than the more concentrated foods.</p>

<p><strong>Proprietary Foods.</strong>&mdash;Certain proprietary infant foods<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
are at times found to be exceedingly valuable, since they
furnish food in a concentrated and digestible form. Among
these Mellin&rsquo;s Food, Racahout, and Imperial Granum may
be mentioned.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHRONIC ENTERITIS</h3>

<p><strong>The Stools.</strong>&mdash;When the diarrhea is chronic in character,
the character of the stools indicates the seat of the
inflammation. When there is a great deal of undigested
food found in them the upper part of the bowel is more
affected; when the stools contain more mucus than food
the lower bowel is the chief seat of the trouble. The frequency
and fluidity of the stools impose a great strain upon
the entire body, causing a progressive emaciation and
anemia.</p>

<p>The treatment is similar to that instituted in acute
attacks. The starvation r&eacute;gime cannot be carried out for
a long period. Efforts must be made to ascertain the cause
of the trouble and to overcome it. This is, as a rule, more
easily accomplished with adults than with infants and children.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The diet is the chief point of
observation and attention. The same care must be observed
as is found necessary in the after-treatment of acute
diarrhea. The patient must be cautioned not to eat indigestible
foods or those which are known to cause trouble
in this respect. She must be warned against eating when
over-tired.</p>


<h3>ENTEROCOLITIS</h3>

<p>Enterocolitis is an inflammation of the lower intestines
and colon. The stools contain more mucus than those
occurring when the inflammation is higher up in the intestines
and blood is also more frequent in these stools. The
prostration is more marked and the fever apt to be higher
than in ordinary diarrheal attacks. However, acute attacks
of enterocolitis do not produce the marked anemia or the
emaciation which are so common in the chronic cases of
enteritis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
Dietetic treatment the same as that used in acute
diarrhea.</p>


<h3>ACUTE DYSENTERY</h3>

<p>Dysentery is a disease in which the seat of inflammation
is the colon. The bowels are distended and tender, the
pain at times is acute and spasmodic, and the fever moderate.
The constant desire to defecate and the straining
which accompanies each effort, as well as the small stools,
containing both blood and mucus, furnish the characteristic
symptoms of this disease. Rest in bed is absolutely necessary;
the patient must be induced to use a bedpan.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The diet consists entirely of
liquids as in acute diarrhea, the same careful r&eacute;gime being
observed as in those conditions. The soreness in the abdomen
is at times relieved by spice poultices or a hot turpentine
stupe.</p>


<h3>CHRONIC DYSENTERY</h3>

<p>When the above conditions become chronic, the patient
loses weight and strength rapidly, becomes anemic and
emaciated. The treatment, like that used in the acute disease,
consists of rest and liquid diet. The medicinal treatment
is left entirely in the hands of the physician.</p>


<h3>APPENDICITIS</h3>

<p>Appendicitis is an inflammation of the vermiform appendix.
It may be acute or chronic in form.</p>

<p><strong>Symptoms.</strong>&mdash;The disease is manifested by sudden pain
in the right side, tenderness over the seat of the inflammation,
and a localized rigidity of the right iliac fossa. The
attack is as a rule accompanied by fever which may run as
high as 103&deg; or 104&deg; F. The patient may suffer from nausea
and vomiting. Constipation is generally an annoying symptom
of the disease.</p>

<p><strong>Rest in Bed.</strong>&mdash;The treatment of the acute attack consists
of total abstinence from food for twelve or more hours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
until the most acute stage has passed and the patient either
passes into the hands of the surgeon or the symptoms begin
to subside in violence. It is necessary that the patient be
kept in bed, not being allowed to rise for anything. The
nurse must make him understand that his recovery, possibly
his very life, depends upon his absolute quiet during the
early stages of the disease.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;When the first acute symptoms
have passed, the diet must consist of fluids, well-skimmed
meat broths, buttermilk, peptonized milk, albumen water or
albumenized orange juice. No solid food must be given
until the acute symptoms have disappeared. When the tenderness
in the right side has entirely left him and he no
longer suffers the pain or nausea, a gradual return to a normal
diet may be made. The patient must be cautioned
against eating indigestible foods, as an attack of intestinal
indigestion may readily start up an irritation in the susceptible
appendix and cause a second attack of appendicitis
which is often of a more serious nature than the first.</p>

<p><strong>Convalescent Diet.</strong>&mdash;The return to solid food is made
gradually as in other intestinal disorders, by giving the most
digestible foods first. Soft toast, soft eggs, fine cereal gruels,
well-cooked rice, well-baked white potatoes, meat, wine or
fruit jellies; then lightly broiled beefsteak, lamb chop,
chicken, sweetbreads, or brains given in small quantities
until the intestinal tract has regained its vigor.</p>

<p><strong>Foods to Be Avoided.</strong>&mdash;Highly seasoned foods must
be avoided on account of their astringent qualities, which
may cause constipation. Long, tough-fibered meats, coarse
vegetables, rich foods, in fact anything which may cause
intestinal indigestion, must be eliminated from the dietary.
A decomposition of the foods lying in the lower part of the
small intestine is dangerous to such individuals, since such
products are highly toxic in character and exceedingly irritating
to the already tender appendix.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHRONIC CONSTIPATION</h3>

<p>Chronic constipation is so universal a condition that it
must be treated and overcome whenever it is possible. This
condition is not only the cause but the result of disease. It
may be induced by improper food, poor hygiene, sedentary
habits, lack of exercise, the taking of drug preparations such
as cough sirups which contain opium in some form, the
constant taking of cathartics and enemas, or it may be an
hereditary condition.</p>

<p><strong>Diet, Exercise, and Fresh Air.</strong>&mdash;The chief means of
overcoming this deplorable chronic condition is by regulating
the diet and increasing the amount of exercise in the
fresh air.</p>

<p>At times it is necessary to resort to artificial stimulation
of the intestinal movements; at others, on account of the
disease of which it is only one of the symptoms, it is dangerous
to irritate the already inflamed mucous membranes
lining the intestinal wall. In these cases the physician prescribes
the method of procedure. In ordinary cases, however,
the following suggestions may be used as a guide in
overcoming the condition.</p>

<p><strong>Available Foods.</strong>&mdash;It must be borne in mind that the
food must not be too concentrated in character or it will be
so completely absorbed as to leave little or no residue for
the feces, and since the waste products of metabolism, both
of food and body materials, must be eliminated, a certain
amount of fecal matter is necessary to assist in this work.
Vegetables, such as celery, turnips, lettuce, asparagus, string
beans, spinach, and beans, lentils, lima beans, and onions;
fruits, such as raisins, figs, and prunes; and cereals which
have not had all the bran removed, such as cut oats, cracked
wheat, etc., on account of the cellulose they contain, act admirably
in overcoming chronic constipation. It is found,
however, that when even these are not sufficient in certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
cases, bran added to the food, either alone, with the breakfast
cereal, or in the form of biscuits, muffins, or cookies,
will give just the necessary amount of ballast to the food
mass to make it stimulate the peristaltic movements by its
pressure upon the intestinal walls.</p>

<p><strong>Stimuli to Peristalsis.</strong>&mdash;Foods yielding certain acids
exert a stimulating action upon intestinal peristalsis.</p>

<p><strong>Available Foods.</strong>&mdash;Those particularly valuable for this
purpose are limes, oranges, apples, prunes, figs, raisins, and
most fruit juices (with the exception of blackberries, which
are constipating), tomatoes, and rhubarb. The fruit juices
may be diluted with water or carbonated water (in the latter
case the action is increased because of the gas contained
in the water), and taken the first thing in the morning, or
the fruit may be eaten at night before retiring, and in the
morning on an empty stomach. Prune pulp or prune jelly
may be given to children as well as to adults. The action
of this fruit is augmented by the addition of senna leaves. A
conserve made of prunes, figs, and raisins given in teaspoonful
doses at night and before breakfast often gives splendid
results in curing chronic constipation.</p>

<p><strong>Gas-forming Foods.</strong>&mdash;The eating of foods which give
rise to a slight formation of gas owing to their tendency to
ferment likewise acts as a stimulus to intestinal movements.
Among these may be mentioned honey, molasses, cauliflower,
cabbage, spinach, and onions. If the honey and molasses
are poured on bran muffins or biscuits, on breakfast
food, or added as sweetening agents to cookies, they will be
found particularly valuable. Care must be taken, however,
not to give too much of either of these foods or they will
disturb the digestion and do more harm than good.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Salt Foods.</strong>&mdash;Foods such as herring, caviar,
anchovies, ham, etc., on account of the salt they contain,
exert a stimulating effect upon the movements in the small
and large intestines. Graham bread, spread with brown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
sugar, molasses, or honey, makes an acceptable addition to
the meal of the majority of children and to that of many
adults.</p>

<p><strong>Fats and Mineral Oils.</strong>&mdash;The use of fats is often recommended;
olive oil may be given in tablespoonful doses
before breakfast and at night or it may be served on vegetables
and salads. If one or two tablespoonfuls are taken
at night and before breakfast, it may act as a laxative. In
many cases, however, this oil is completely absorbed in the
small intestine and hence there is none left to lubricate the
passage for the food mass. When vegetable oils do not
prove satisfactory, mineral oils may be substituted. These
oils have absolutely no fuel value and are not digested in
the intestinal canal but mix with the fecal mass, softening it
and stimulating its passage through the large intestine.
There are certain individuals with whom the mineral oils
do not act as lubricants and instead of softening the feces
and lubricating the passage will slip through the intestinal
canal without carrying the feces along.</p>

constipation:</p>

<h3>AUTO-INTOXICATION</h3>

<p>Auto-intoxication is a condition produced by the absorption
of the decomposition products of food in the intestinal
canal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
<strong>Absorption of Toxins.</strong>&mdash;As a rule the condition occurs
in individuals suffering more or less from constipation
which may be due to errors in diet or a lack of tone in the
intestines, giving rise to a sluggishness in the peristaltic
movements in this region of the alimentary canal. In certain
individuals the liver is more or less sluggish, or in some
way fails to do its regular work of detoxifying the products
of metabolism brought in by the blood stream, in which case
these toxins are reabsorbed into the system and induce a
condition known as auto-intoxication.</p>

<p><strong>Care of Bowels.</strong>&mdash;As a rule the patient has more or
less fever, nausea and at times vomiting. The head aches
and the abdomen may be distended by the formation of gas
in the intestines. The treatment is like that used in the
majority of intestinal disorders. The bowels are emptied
by means of soapsuds or salts and glycerin enemas. Certain
physicians recommend an enema made with equal
quantities of milk and molasses, with enough hot water
added to make a thin, warm solution. Care must be used
in preparing this flatus enema on account of the danger of
curdling the milk with the acid in the molasses and the hot
water. If the solution should curdle it must be discarded
and a fresh solution prepared. A flatus enema containing
salts, glycerin, and a few drops of turpentine is also valuable
in removing the gas formed by the action of the putrefactive
bacteria upon the unabsorbed food mass. This enema must
be given &ldquo;high&rdquo; so as to reach the spot in the colon where
it may efficiently do its work.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The diet may consist of fluids
for the first few days, or as long as the fever continues.
<strong>Buttermilk</strong> is probably the best fluid food to use under such
conditions, since it not only nourishes, but likewise furnishes
lactic acid bacteria which aid in the destruction of the more
harmful bacteria, especially numerous under the conditions
just mentioned. When whole milk is given it is best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
to peptonize it. Well-strained meat broths may be given
occasionally to vary the diet and albumenized orange juice
or orange juice in carbonated water may also be given once
or twice daily during the febrile period. After this, the
patient may have well-cooked cereal gruels. These may be
dextrinized with vegetable diastase (Taka diastase) if necessary.
A return to normal diet is made gradually to prevent
a return of the trouble. The patient should be advised
against overeating, and eating highly seasoned or indigestible
foods.</p>

<p><strong>Convalescent Diet.</strong>&mdash;The diets recommended for use
during convalescence from other intestinal disorders may
serve here, reducing, however, the allowance of meat, since
meat proteins are particularly susceptible to attacks of
putrefactive bacteria.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary Precautions.</strong>&mdash;After the body has returned to
its normal state, the patient must keep in mind the danger
arising from constipation and intestinal putrefaction. The
following menu is given as a guide to aid the individual in
selecting a diet which will in a measure assist in preventing
future attacks of intestinal putrefaction and auto-intoxication:</p>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<h4>DIARRHEA</h4>

<p><strong>Character.</strong>&mdash;Acute or chronic, accompanying many
pathological conditions, especially in children in whom diarrhea
in any form must be given immediate attention.</p>

<p><strong>Causes.</strong>&mdash;Errors in diet, polluted water or milk, ptomaines,
bad hygiene, and certain drugs.</p>

<p><strong>Bowels.</strong>&mdash;The stools vary in number from three to
twelve a day. They may be greenish yellow in color, containing
mucus and particles of undigested food and, in prolonged
cases, blood.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment.</strong>&mdash;Rest in bed and total abstinence from
food for from twenty-four to forty-eight hours. Salines are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
usually given by mouth or by rectum, but this is left to the
discretion of the physician. Very little water is given by
mouth during the period of total abstinence. Thirst is relieved
by bits of ice, and enemas are given if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Administration of Diet.</strong>&mdash;When acute symptoms have
disappeared and the stools are becoming more normal in
character and number, a fluid diet of from four to six ounces
is administered every three or four hours or oftener if
patient is very weak. Brandy may likewise be given in
cases in which exhaustion is marked.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;Concentrated foods of the simplest
character and only those known to agree. Proprietary
infant or invalid foods, except malted foods, which exert a
laxative effect; among those found to be good may be mentioned
Mellin&rsquo;s Food, Imperial Granum, and Racahout.</p>

<p><strong>Foods to Be Avoided.</strong>&mdash;Fatty foods; pork, veal, and
shellfish; all foods that are subject to fermentation in the
stomach or intestinal tract (sugar).</p>

<p><strong>Foods to Be Limited.</strong>&mdash;Fluids, soup, beverages, etc.,
because they impose more work on the intestines.</p>


<h4>ENTEROCOLITIS</h4>

<p><strong>Seat of Inflammation.</strong>&mdash;Lower intestine and colon.</p>

<p><strong>Differentiating Characteristics.</strong>&mdash;More mucus and
blood in stools; greater prostration; greater rise of temperature;
and less anemia than in chronic enteritis.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;Practically the same as in other
diarrheas.</p>


<h4>DYSENTERY</h4>

<p><strong>Characteristic Symptoms.</strong>&mdash;Acute and spasmodic pain,
tenderness and distention in the bowels, moderate fever,
straining and a constant desire to defecate, small stools containing
blood and mucus, loss of weight and marked anemia
when condition becomes chronic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
<strong>Treatment.</strong>&mdash;Rest in bed absolutely necessary; the use
of the bedpan made obligatory; soreness relieved by hot
turpentine stupes or spice poultices.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;No food for a period of from
thirty-six to forty-eight hours, after which fluids and the
r&eacute;gime recommended in acute diarrhea are advisable. In
chronic dysentery the diet is practically the same. The extreme
exhaustion and anemia accompanying these conditions
make it necessary to increase the diet carefully but
soon to offset as far as possible the devastating effects of the
disease.</p>


<h4>APPENDICITIS</h4>

<p><strong>Treatment.</strong>&mdash;Confinement to bed is absolutely necessary
while acute symptoms prevail. The life of the patient
may depend upon the care with which this &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; period
is carried out. No food should be given for twelve or more
hours to enable the physician to make a proper diagnosis
and to allow the intestinal tract and appendix complete rest
from the irritating effects of food passing down the canal.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;<strong>Acute Stage</strong>: Total abstinence
for a period, after which fluids as given in other acute intestinal
disorders. No solid food until acute symptoms have
subsided; then a gradual return to normal.</p>

<p><strong>Convalescence.</strong>&mdash;When tenderness in right side has disappeared,
the return to a normal diet is made gradually.
Gelatin, soft eggs, soft toast, fine cereal gruels, well-cooked
rice, well-baked white potatoes, tender rare beefsteak or
lamb chops, the breast of chicken, sweetbreads, and brains
are recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Relapse or Recurring Appendicitis.</strong>&mdash;The patient
must be warned against eating indigestible foods or any kind
of foods liable to cause constipation; also against overeating
or eating when over-heated or over-tired. One attack predisposes
to another, hence the above precautions are necessary
to prevent the condition from becoming chronic.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span></p>

<h4>CHRONIC CONSTIPATION</h4>

<p><strong>Causes.</strong>&mdash;Improper foods, indoor occupations leading
to a lack of fresh air and exercise, bad hygiene, certain drugs,
such as cough sirups, etc., containing opium in some form,
constant use of cathartics and enemas to move the bowels,
heredity.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment: Foods to Be Avoided.</strong>&mdash;Highly
spiced foods must be avoided on account of their astringent
qualities, too concentrated foods because they fail to furnish
the necessary bulk without which the waste matter
cannot pass out of the body at a sufficient rate of speed to
prevent putrefaction taking place in the intestinal tract.</p>

<p><strong>Foods Stimulating Peristalsis</strong> on account of their bulk:
Bulky foods, such as vegetables, cabbage, turnips, cucumbers,
spinach, beans, celery, lettuce, etc.; cereal foods containing
a high percentage of bran, bran bread and cookies,
fruits such as raisins, prunes, figs.</p>

<p><strong>Foods Acting as Stimuli to Intestinal Movements</strong> on
account of their acid content: Limes, oranges, apples,
prunes, figs, raisins, most fruit juices (blackberries excepted),
rhubarb, tomatoes, cauliflower, spinach, onions,
honey, and molasses; senna leaves likewise have a distinct
action upon the peristaltic movement of the intestines,
hence are included here.</p>

<p><strong>Precautions.</strong>&mdash;Emphasis should be placed upon the
dangers of (1) overeating any of the foods indicated in the
above list and thus bringing about conditions more dangerous
in result than the original disturbance; (2) the taking
of drugs to move bowels on account of the ease with which
the habit is acquired and the consequent inability of the
bowels to move without such whips; (3) the taking of too
little water, thereby allowing a too concentrated condition
of the food mass and a consequent accumulation of substances
which inhibit peristaltic action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
<strong>Use of Fats and Mineral Oils.</strong>&mdash;Olive and other vegetable
oils, if not completely absorbed, are advised on account
of their lubricating effects. The same can be said of
the mineral oils which have no food value but in many cases
furnish the lubricant necessary in certain individuals suffering
from sluggish intestinal peristalsis.</p>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<br />
FEVERS IN GENERAL</h2>


<p>Fever is an abnormal condition characterized by an elevation
of body temperature, quickened respiration and circulation,
and a certain amount of tissue waste. This elevation
of temperature may be due to various conditions,
such as local inflammation, infectious diseases, disturbed
metabolism and food poisoning (ptomaine).</p>

<p><strong>Tissue Waste in Fevers.</strong>&mdash;Fevers of short duration,
such as accompany colds, tonsillitis, chicken pox and intermittent
fever, remittent fever, and at times malarial fever,
do not cause sufficient tissue waste to make the nutrition the
important feature of the treatment. In ptomaine poisoning
the tissue waste may be great, but it is the result of the
poisoning, as is the fever, so that the diet needs to be adjusted
only after the disturbance has abated. In the beginning,
starvation is instituted and the fever disappears when
the poisoning is controlled.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment of Fevers of Short Duration.</strong>&mdash;In all fevers
of short duration then, the treatment is directed with the
following points in mind: (1) relieving the cause, (2) preventing
gastro-intestinal disturbances, (3) saving the heart,
kidneys, etc., extra strain.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;In doing this the diet is so formulated
as to meet the above-mentioned conditions, and
fluids seem the best form in which food can be given to
bring about the desired results. The quantity of fluids
should be small and the intervals between feedings short.
Two-hour intervals seem best in the beginning. These
intervals are lengthened as the fever decreases and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
amount of food at each feeding increased. When convalescence
is established, semi-solid, soft or convalescent diet
may replace the fluids and the patient gradually brought
back to a normal diet.</p>

<p><strong>Fluid Diet.</strong>&mdash;The following foods constitute a fluid
diet: milk, whole milk, plain, peptonized, or albumenized,
buttermilk, koumiss, malted milk, milk shake, milk punch,
cream, whey; fruit beverages, plain, albumenized, or mixed
with whole raw egg; eggnog, milk and ginger ale, cocoa,
strained gruels, broths re&euml;nforced with egg or plain. Carbonated
water may be added to milk or fruit beverages.</p>

<p><strong>Schedule of Feeding.</strong>&mdash;The following schedule may be
used as a guide in fevers of short duration:<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The return to normal diet is made with caution that the

raised again by over-feeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
<strong>Energy Requirements.</strong>&mdash;In fevers of short duration it
is not difficult to regulate the amount of food necessary for
the maintenance of the patient, since the body will, as a
rule, adjust itself when the cause of the fever has been removed.
At times, however, it is necessary to make an effort
to tempt the appetite of the patient when convalescence
is established, that recovery may be made more rapid and
complete.</p>

<p><strong>Care of the Mouth.</strong>&mdash;Probably there is nothing more
essential in the treatment of fevers in general and typhoid
fever in particular than the care of the mouth. Well-nourished
patients rarely ever show the dry, cracked tongue and
lips that was formerly one of the common occurrences in
typhoid fever. However, in any febrile condition the mouth
is apt to acquire a disagreeable taste; this &ldquo;bad taste&rdquo; is so
prominent in certain cases as to render it difficult for the
patient to eat. This can be, to a great extent, eliminated
by the use of aseptic mouth washes. When the patient is
not strong enough to rinse the mouth before and after eating,
the nurse must use a swab for the purpose. The food
must be carefully selected and attractively served and every
effort made to make food as dainty and palatable as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Thirst.</strong>&mdash;Thirst is relieved with crushed ice, fruit beverages,
and carbonated waters. In certain conditions it is
necessary to limit the fluids, but in typhoid fever the giving
of the requisite amount of liquids is one of the most difficult
tasks confronting the nurse. It is wise to find out the beverages
particularly liked by the patient and, whenever it is
possible, make use of them. As a rule alcohol is not necessary
in the diet of typhoid fever patients. However, in certain
cases of that disease, as well as in febrile conditions
induced by other causes, the use of alcoholic stimulation
may be necessary; it must be left to the discretion of the
physician to prescribe it.</p>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p><strong>Intestinal Disturbances</strong> are accountable for the majority
of the fevers of short duration during infancy and childhood,
and in many of those cases in adults.</p>

<p><strong>Malaria</strong> causes an elevation of temperature which is, as
a rule, of short duration.</p>

<p><strong>Contagious Diseases</strong>, such as scarlet fever, measles,
whooping cough, and mumps, are likewise accompanied by
more or less elevation of temperature.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong> consists of a period of rest in bed, with an
abstinence from food, in order that the disease may manifest
itself, and also that any offending food material which
may cause the fever may have an opportunity to pass out
of the body.</p>

<p><strong>The Heart</strong>, in some of the diseases accompanied by an
elevation of temperature, is more or less strained; this is
particularly true in tonsillitis, diphtheria, etc.</p>

<p><strong>The Kidneys</strong> are likewise taxed in certain diseases, even
when the fever is not great or lasting; this is found to be the
case in scarlet fever, tonsillitis, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment</strong> consists in giving no food for a
period lasting from twenty-four to forty-eight hours. This
is followed by a liquid diet, milk and broth particularly,
which is continued as long as the fever remains.</p>

<p><strong>Convalescent Diet</strong> is instituted as soon as the fever has
disappeared and acute symptoms subside.</p>

<p><strong>Thirst</strong> is apt to be great with any elevation of temperature.
It is relieved by water, crushed ice, and fruit beverages.</p>

<p><strong>The Mouth</strong> requires much care, even in fevers of short
duration. A simple antiseptic wash should be used several
times each day.</p>

<p><strong>Nitrogen Equilibrium</strong> is not sufficiently disturbed in
such cases to require taking into account. Should the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
disease, however, develop into one causing a material breaking
down of the body tissues, measures must be instituted to
prevent the upsetting of the nitrogen balance in the body.</p>

<br />
TYPHOID FEVER</h2>


<p><strong>Definition.</strong>&mdash;Typhoid fever is an acute infectious disease
excited by specific bacteria (Eberth). The intestines
become the seat of ulcerations (Peyer&rsquo;s patches), which at
times perforate. The chief symptoms of the disease are
fever, headache, abdominal distention and tenderness, more
or less diarrhea and a rose-colored abdominal rash. The
source of infection is found in the intestinal contents of a
typhoid fever patient, which in some way come in contact
with and infect drinking water, milk, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Energy Expenditure in Febrile Conditions.</strong>&mdash;In febrile
conditions the energy expenditures increase as much as
twenty-five per cent. In some cases, and when bacterial
activity is added to this, as is the case in typhoid fever, the
tissue waste becomes correspondingly greater; hence the
nutrition assumes the chief r&ocirc;le in such cases, for in no other
way can the tissue waste and energy expenditure be met
and overcome.</p>

<p><strong>Energy Expenditures in Typhoid.</strong>&mdash;In typhoid fever
the problem of meeting these expenditures, and at the same
time protecting the heart and kidneys from the abnormal
strain placed upon them in handling the toxic substances
produced as the result of bacterial action in the intestines,
becomes very real. It requires eternal vigilance and patience
not only from the physician but especially from the
nurse, with whom so much responsibility rests. The dietetic
treatment necessarily is the principal point to which all
efforts must be directed. By this is understood not only the
type and amount of food given the patient, but the behavior

of this food in the body as manifested by the symptoms,
namely, the appearance of the patient, the condition of the
mouth, the abdominal distention, tenderness, diarrhea,
nausea, and vomiting, the hemorrhage which at times occurs
in spite of all care, and perforation which sometimes results
in death, and acidosis or acetonuria. All of which makes
this disease one requiring the most efficient attention from
a nutritional standpoint.</p>

<p><strong>Energy Requirements in Typhoid Fever.</strong>&mdash;In a previous
chapter the energy expenditures of the normal individual
were dealt with; it was seen that a man at rest, that
is, in bed, not rising for anything, had a normal expenditure
of energy requiring from 1900 to 2200 calories per day.
Now, if these expenditures were increased twenty-five per
cent. by the fever and still more by the bacterial activities,
it is clearly seen that the diet must be increased in proportion
if the tissue waste is to be prevented and the normal
body weight of the patient maintained.</p>

<p><strong>High Calorie Diet.</strong>&mdash;Dr. Warren Coleman,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> to whom
we owe so much for his pioneer work in feeding in typhoid
fever, devised the so-called &ldquo;High Calorie Diet.&rdquo; This consists
of foods of the most digestible type prepared in the
simplest way. The weight of the patient is considered and
the diet directed with the following points in view: (1) to
cover the energy requirements of the body; (2) to make
good the tissue waste which at times amounts to a loss of
from 15 to 20 grams of nitrogen a day (or from &frac14; to &frac34;
pound of muscle);<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> (3) to check or prevent the development
of serious complications, kidney, heart, etc.</p>

<p>In the Metabolism Ward at Bellevue Hospital, New
York,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> the best results are obtained by the giving of diets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
furnishing from 60 to 80 calories per kilogram per day, or
from 4000 to 5500 calories.</p>

<p><strong>Fluid Diet.</strong>&mdash;It is clearly seen that it would be practically
impossible to obtain a sufficient number of calories
by using milk alone or even a mixed fluid diet to supply the
above requirements. Since milk alone in such a diet would
probably cause such discomfort as to make it unwise to
continue it, the ideal diet would seem to be one in which the
fats, proteins and carbohydrates are furnished in a semi-solid
or solid form, together with a sufficient amount of
liquids to prevent too great concentration in the food, to
relieve thirst, and to act as a carrier of re&euml;nforcing substances,
such as lactose, eggs, casein products, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Absorption Food.</strong>&mdash;The question as to whether the
food is absorbed when given to typhoid fever patients has
often been asked. That it is has been proved in the series
of calorimeter experiments conducted in the Metabolism
Ward, Bellevue Hospital.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Here it was demonstrated that
under the high calorie diet the patient consumed large
amounts of food with relish and that which was not utilized
by the organism immediately was stored for future needs.</p>

<p><strong>Diarrhea and Tympanites.</strong>&mdash;Constant attention and
study of various typhoid patients taking a maximum
amount of food a day has proved that the diarrhea and
tympanites which at times occur in these as well as other
cases are due to too much of one or another of the food
constituents rather than to the general amount of the diet.
Diarrhea may then be traced to an excess of cream, and
the tympanites to an excess of lactose, and a reconstruction
of the dietary will often obviate the trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Increasing the Diet.</strong>&mdash;It is always advisable to &ldquo;go
slow&rdquo; in adding new foods to the diet; milk, cream, eggs
and lactose are the principal articles constituting the diet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
To this are added fine cereal gruels, well-cooked rice, rice
custard, tapioca custard, junket, ice cream, wine or fruit
jellies, toast, eggs (soft-cooked, poached, creamed, or raw,
in milk), or fruit beverages, cocoa, buttermilk, koumiss,
certain proprietary infant foods such as Mellin&rsquo;s Food,
Eskay&rsquo;s Food, Racahout and malted milk, with a well-baked
potato, milk, cream or buttered toast added as the
condition and appetite warrant.</p>

<p><strong>Milk Diet.</strong>&mdash;The following milk diets<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> were devised
by Dr. Coleman to be given in certain cases of typhoid
fever during the acute stage. These formulas consist of
milk, cream and lactose and furnish from 1000 to 3000
calories per day.</p>

<p><strong>Varying the Diet.</strong>&mdash;It has been found possible, even
advisable, to vary the above diets in many cases. The
disease extends over such a long period that if a fluid diet
is adhered to the patient would grow exceedingly tired and
even disgusted if milk alone was given, hence a mixed fluid
diet such as is used in the Presbyterian Hospital, New York
City is suggested.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p><strong>Advantages of Newer Treatment.</strong>&mdash;A marked difference
is noticed in the patients treated by the old starvation
diets and those given the high calorie diet. Dr. Coleman
states<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> that while the range of temperature is apparently
unaffected, the total duration of the disease is shortened
in some instances by months through the shortening
of convalescence. He further states that certain symptoms
which have hitherto been attributed to the specific action of
the typhoid bacillus have been discovered to be due to
faulty methods of treatment, particularly to an inadequate
or improperly balanced diet. The various investigators
who have made the study and treatment of this disease a
lifework claim that the mortality from this disease has
been tremendously reduced by the use of the high calorie
diets which maintain the nutrition of the patient throughout
the disease, thus eliminating the horrors of the long,
tedious convalescence which tried the nerves and patience
of the patient, the nurse, and the physician. There is no
doubt that so far as the administering of this diet is concerned
it requires more effort on the part of the nurse than
the old treatment of a glass of milk every two or three hours.
It is necessary for the nurse to be able to carry out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
orders as expressed in the diet lists, to be able to compute
the proteins (nitrogen), fats, and carbohydrates in a food
or recipe. But this is readily done by studying the tables
given in the first section of this text. She must likewise be
able to recognize the symptoms as they arise. In hospitals,
the urinalysis is made as a routine procedure. In private
cases the physician will either have the analyses made or
expect the nurse to be able to make the simple tests.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>One of the greatest difficulties attending the administering
of the high calorie diet is persuading the patient to take
sufficient food for his needs. The fluids are often more difficult
to give in quantity than the more solid foods, and it
requires much tact on the part of the nurse to prevent a
refusal of the necessary fluids. However, if the patient is
possessed of even ordinary intelligence, an explanation of
the reasons for the large amount of food will as a rule be all
that is necessary. Few individuals will willingly prolong
an illness attended with the discomforts generally present
in typhoid fever.</p>

<p><strong>Hemorrhage</strong> occurs in a certain percentage of cases of
typhoid regardless of the diet, whether it be a strictly milk
diet or the high calorie diet just described. The measures
to combat them are essentially the same. It is necessary
to guard against excessive tympanites since the pressure
therefrom against the ulcerated intestinal walls may
cause perforation resulting in hemorrhage. Lactose at times
causes an evolution of gas as do fats under certain circumstances.
Hence it is necessary to follow symptoms and
watch the stools in order to determine which food material
is to blame for the tympanites and reduce the allowance of
that food in the diet.</p>

<p><strong>Idiosyncrasies against Milk.</strong>&mdash;Certain individuals
manifest an inability to take milk. This may be real or
imaginary. When it is a true idiosyncrasy, it may be found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
necessary to substitute some other food for the milk in the
diet, but great care should be taken to determine the real
character of the disagreement before eliminating so invaluable
a food from the diet. When the disagreement proves
merely a distaste for milk, some of the different methods
used in disguising it, such as flavoring or coloring, may be
practiced. Otherwise, it is well under the circumstances to
use some of the pre-digestive methods in order to increase
its utilization. It is well to emphasize the value of accurate
data on this subject as it is exceedingly difficult to administer
a high calorie diet without milk in some form.</p>

<p><strong>Essential Points.</strong>&mdash;Thus the dietary in typhoid fever is
seen to be the most important part of the treatment. A
careful study of the tables will enable the nurse to do her
part in nourishing the patient. It is necessary that she be
able to compute the nitrogen, carbohydrates, and fats in a
diet and arrange these constituents in such a way as to give
the desired amount of each in the dietary and in a form
acceptable to the patient.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p><strong>Rate of Metabolism</strong> is greatly increased in typhoid fever
even over other febrile conditions, not only on account of
the elevation and duration of the fever, but also on account
of the activities of the specific bacteria in the intestinal tract
which differentiate this disease from other febrile
conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Energy Expenditures and Requirements</strong> of the body in
typhoid fever, on account of the character of the disease,
are much greater than those of the normal individual and
must be met by an increase in the diet if the body is to be
saved from destruction.</p>

<p><strong>The Bowels.</strong>&mdash;Diarrhea develops during any period of
the disease due to excess amount of fat or to a disagreement
of some of the other food constituents. It is advisable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
cut down the allowance of cream temporarily and to watch
stools and other symptoms for evidences of dietetic errors.</p>

<p><strong>Hemorrhage</strong> must be guarded against by eliminating,
as far as possible, all substances liable to cause an excessive
gas formation in the intestines.</p>

<p><strong>Absorption of Food</strong> is as a rule good. The patient is
usually able to handle a large quantity of food provided it is
judiciously administered with a due regard to the symptoms
manifested at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Simplicity of Diet</strong> is absolutely essential. All the materials
must be selected carefully according to the physician&rsquo;s
orders and prepared with the greatest care in order
to prevent digestive disturbances.</p>

<p><strong>High Calorie Diet</strong> is one in which the fuel value of the
food ingested meets or exceeds the energy expenditures of
the patient. Foods composing the diet are, milk and eggs
for the proteins, with carbohydrates and fats in their simplest
and most digestible form to balance the diet.</p>

<p><strong>Administering a High Calorie Diet</strong> is accomplished
successfully provided the nurse exercises care with regard
to the symptoms arising from time to time. These must be
carefully noted and reported to the physician, for in this
way only is it possible to give a sufficient quantity of food
to cover the excessive breaking down of the body due to the
disease.</p>

<p><strong>Fluid Diet</strong> is at times necessary since certain patients
cannot tolerate a high calorie diet, but this is a point decided
by the physician. A fluid diet consists of fluids alone,
milk in particular, with broths and fruit beverages as ordered.
The milk is given in definite amounts and at stated
intervals.</p>

<p><strong>Milk Diet</strong> is one consisting solely of milk or in which the
bulk of the nourishment is furnished by milk. It may be
re&euml;nforced or not as desired. Lactose is the substance commonly
used as a re&euml;nforcing agent. It is impossible to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
cover the energy expenditures of typhoid fever with a milk
diet even if it is perfectly administered, but certain complications
make it, at times, the only rational method of
feeding.</p>

<p><strong>The Advantages of High Calorie Diet</strong> over other diets
are distinctly noticeable in typhoid fever patients. Those
treated by this method are more comfortable during the
course of the disease and are saved a long, tedious convalescence
which has made the starvation treatment a thing of
horror in the past. The return to health is attended by a
much better physical condition when the patients are well
nourished than is possible when they are kept on practically
a starvation ration. The mortality from the disease has
been materially lessened by the administration of the high
calorie diet.</p>

<p><strong>Acidosis</strong> may develop in typhoid fever patients and
must be guarded against. The behavior of the fat in the
body should be carefully watched and the amount reduced
at the first evidence of acidosis. At the same time an increase
in the carbohydrates may assist in overcoming the
condition. This adjusting of the diet, however, is entirely
in the hands of the physician.</p>

<p><strong>The Kidneys</strong> in typhoid fever patients are under a
great strain, chiefly on account of the increased rate of
metabolism. Great care must be exercised in the dietetic
treatment to prevent these organs from being overworked
with a consequent development of nephritic conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Care of the Mouth</strong> in any febrile condition is important,
but especially so in typhoid fever, where the disease itself
causes a most unpleasant taste in the mouth. This prevents
the taking of nourishment with any degree of comfort,
hence the mouth should be cleansed before and after
each feeding. Any of the aseptic mouth washes may be
used.</p>

<p><strong>Thirst</strong> may be relieved by plain or carbonated waters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>300]</a></span>
fruit beverages, and crushed ice. When in certain complications
the fluids in the diet are in a measure restricted, ice is
used and water is given in spoonful doses. This, however,
is the exceptional, rather than the ordinary state of affairs.</p>

<p><strong>Increasing the Diet</strong> after a fluid diet must be made with
great care in order to prevent a relapse. Following the high
calorie diet the increase is simple. The patient passes from
the prescribed foods to meat with apparently no effort. The
increase should not be made, however, until convalescence
is firmly established.</p>

<p><strong>Re&euml;nforcing the Diet.</strong>&mdash;On account of the great increase
in the rate of metabolism and because of the difficulty
of furnishing the requisite number of calories in the diet,
re&euml;nforcing agents such as lactose, eggs, some forms of
casein, or beef preparations are used.</p>

<p><strong>Idiosyncrasies</strong> against certain foods are, at times, manifested
by patients. Efforts must be made to determine
whether they are real or imaginary before eliminating any
food which may be of importance to their future welfare.</p>

<br />
DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY TRACT</h2>

<h3>TUBERCULOSIS, PNEUMONIA, AND TONSILLITIS</h3>


<h3>TUBERCULOSIS</h3>

<p>The dietetic treatment for tuberculosis must, as in any
other pathological condition, depend largely upon the general
condition of the patient, and the symptoms manifested
at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Character of Disease.</strong>&mdash;The disease may have reached
an acute stage in which the rise of temperature is marked
and the progress of the tuberculous symptoms rapid, or it
may be found to be an old chronic condition in which the
progress is slow.</p>

<p>Again, the patient may be found to be suffering from a
tuberculosis which is neither acute nor very slow. Each of
these stages requires slightly different treatment which,
however, for the main part is much the same.</p>

<p>Individuals having an incipient form of tuberculosis
have been known to develop an acute form of the disease
upon being subjected to a strenuous treatment for some
other and entirely different condition. This has been especially
noticeable in certain individuals to whom the starvation
treatment is given.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment in Acute Stage.</strong>&mdash;The dietetic
treatment of the acute tuberculosis under such circumstances
must necessarily be adapted to that of the original
disease for which starvation was believed to be necessary.
The forbidden foods must still be omitted from the dietary,
but in these cases it is found advisable not to prolong the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
starvation treatment but to substitute foods which will do
the least harm under the circumstances. This is necessary
to cover the energy requirements of the body and to make
good the tissue wasted through the development of the
specific disease.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment in Chronic Stage.</strong>&mdash;The diet for
tuberculosis has been so widely discussed and so universally
used that a few words only seem necessary here. One of the
chief points to be emphasized is the danger arising from
gastro-intestinal disturbances. The digestive apparatus of
the tuberculous individual is more apt to be impaired, so
that any undue exertion required to digest a meal is likely
to bring about disturbances more or less serious in
character.</p>

<p><strong>Method of Administering Diet.</strong>&mdash;For this reason it is
no longer the custom to stuff the patient in an effort to
overcome the inevitable tissue waste, since such treatment
in many cases defeats the end for which it was intended,
bringing on acute indigestion, or at times diarrhea, which
might readily cause a greater loss of body weight than could
possibly be produced by the surplus food given.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusting the Diet.</strong>&mdash;More and more is it coming to be
understood that the diet must be adjusted to suit the individual.
Three wholesome meals a day are insisted upon,
with lunches given between the morning and midday meal
and during the course of the afternoon. Many patients are
found to sleep better after they have partaken of a light
lunch, consisting of hot milk, malted milk, or like beverages
and crackers, so that this third meal is added to the other
five. In this way the individual suffering with tuberculosis
is assured of an efficient diet to meet the needs of the body
without overburdening the digestive apparatus or overtaxing
the excretory organs. The increased metabolism taking
place in such patients, due both to the specific bacteria and
to the febrile condition, is, as far as possible, provided for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>303]</a></span>
<strong>Schedule of Diets.</strong>&mdash;The following dietary r&eacute;gime may
be useful in formulating menus for tubercular patients:</p>

<p class="center smcap">Breakfast</p>

<p class="lists">
Fruits.<br />
5 oz. cereals with cream.<br />
1 or 2 eggs, simply prepared to prevent indigestion.<br />
2 slices of bacon, ham; fish cake or chop.<br />
2 slices of toast or crusty rolls with butter.<br />
Coffee, tea, or cocoa, with or without cream.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p class="center smcap">Lunch</p>

<p class="lists">
Vegetable or cream soups.<br />
Cold meat, lamb chops, oysters, or fish.<br />
Baked white or sweet potato.<br />
1 green vegetable,&mdash;greens, cabbage, spinach, or string beans.<br />
Stewed fruit or baked apple.<br />
Rice or tapioca pudding.<br />
Tea.<br />
Bread and butter.</p>

<p>At the end of the meal one glass containing two-thirds
milk and one-third cream. If the latter disturbs the digestion
reduce the amount temporarily, or add one-half the
contents of a tube of peptonizing powder, or one-quarter of
a glass of limewater.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Dinner</p>

<p class="lists">
Meat, lamb, mutton, chicken, duck, game, or fish.<br />
Mashed or creamed potatoes.<br />
1 or 2 green vegetables.<br />
Simple salads.<br />
Simple desserts consisting of puddings, custards, wine or fruit
jellies, ices or ice cream, sponge cake or angel food cake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span>
The milk and cream is taken at the end of the meal as
directed above.</p>


<p class="center smcap">Lunches</p>

<p>11 <small>A.M.</small>, 4 <small>P.M.</small>, 9 <small>P.M.</small>, consisting of milk, malted milk,
junket, buttermilk, albumenized broth, albumenized fruit
juices, cream, egg, and vichy, eggnogs, served with crackers
or sponge cake; cereal gruels and raw eggs taken with water,
milk, or sherry may likewise form a part of this diet, since
the nourishment in them is both concentrated and palatable.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Eggs.</strong>&mdash;The old method of forcing the patient
to eat a dozen or more raw eggs a day is no longer used, but
three or four a day will be of undoubted value to the
patient, provided they agree. There are patients, however,
with whom eggs act almost as a poison, and in these cases it
is decidedly unwise to force them.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Milk.</strong>&mdash;Milk is to be used abundantly. If it
should disagree, it may be peptonized or modified with limewater.
At any rate, every effort should be made to enable
the patient to drink at least one quart a day, and more, if
possible.</p>

<p>If it fails to agree even when so treated, it should be
abandoned, since the discomfort caused under the circumstances
is more detrimental to the welfare of the individual
than any benefit which he may gain by the small amount
which may be absorbed.</p>

<p><strong>High Calorie Diet.</strong>&mdash;As long as the patient is in bed
the diet cannot be as full as it is made when he is up and
about, as the body is then using more material to provide
for the extra exertion and needs more food to replace that
which has been utilized. Consequently the high calorie
diet<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> will be found as a rule sufficient. As soon as the
patient is able to receive more food without incurring digestional
disturbances, it should be supplied, keeping ever in
mind the danger of its upsetting his digestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
<strong>Advice to Patients.</strong>&mdash;The patient must be impressed
with the necessity for living a simple, wholesome life, free
from excesses of all kinds. The need for a regular r&eacute;gime
in the beginning must be strongly emphasized. Too strenuous
exercise and the consequent over-fatigue at times completely
overcome all the good which has been accomplished
in weeks or even months of studied effort, so that rest is an
essential part of the tuberculous r&eacute;gime. The patient should
sleep from eight to ten hours out of every twenty-four, and
if this sleep is taken in the open, that is, in a tent or on a
sleeping porch, the benefits derived therefrom are
inestimable.</p>

<p><strong>The Bowels.</strong>&mdash;The bowels should move every day,
even if some gentle laxative or an enema has to be used to
bring about the desired result. In a majority of cases, mineral
oil or bran muffins, prunes, raisins, and figs prepared
with senna will be entirely sufficient, however, and these
substances are much less harmful than drugs, for the habit
of taking purgatives becomes a fixed one in a short time,
and is especially liable to become so when the patient is
forced, by reason of the sedentary life, to depend on some
such measures.</p>

<p><strong>Massage.</strong>&mdash;Massage has been found beneficial in many
cases, giving the needed exercise to the body, which it is
otherwise unable to obtain.</p>


<h3>CHRONIC TUBERCULOSIS</h3>

<p>In chronic tuberculosis, the patient should be instructed
in the care necessary for his protection. He should be advised
to report to the physician any symptoms occurring
during the course of the disease, especially any hemorrhage.
He must be reassured of the chances of recovery, even after
hemorrhage has occurred. It is not well to encourage the
habit of taking the temperature or weighing daily, since the
knowledge of the fluctuations which inevitably occur in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
these conditions may worry the patient to such an extent
as to interfere with his final recovery.</p>

<p><strong>Rest, Sleep, and Fresh Air.</strong>&mdash;Moderation in physical
exertion, wholesome food at regular intervals, plenty of rest
and sleep, preferably in the open, and an effort made to
look forward to a complete recovery will go far toward
bringing about the desired result. The tuberculous patient
who sets his mind on recovery, refusing to be discouraged
by the numerous setbacks which may from time to time
occur, has a much greater chance of living a long and useful
life than the patient who makes no effort in this direction.</p>

<p><strong>Re&euml;nforcing the Diet.</strong>&mdash;The following re&euml;nforced foods
have been found valuable in the diet for tuberculosis, especially
in those cases which are confined to bed and in which
the effort to eat causes more or less gastric distress:</p>

<p>Milk, whole milk, milk and cream, milk diluted with
Apollinaris water, peptonized, modified milk, re&euml;nforced
with egg or egg white or re&euml;nforced with one to four tablespoonfuls
of lactose, malted milk, buttermilk, cream, egg,
and vichy, milk shake, milk punch, malted milk shake,
chocolate or cocoa malted milk, albumenized fruit juices,
egg and orange, egg and wine, re&euml;nforced, if desired, with
lactose, albumenized broths, proprietary infant foods, such
as Eskay&rsquo;s Food, Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s Food, Mellin&rsquo;s Food, Racahout,
cream soups re&euml;nforced with lactose or egg, junkets, and ice
cream.</p>


<h3>PNEUMONIA</h3>

<p>The diet in pneumonia is of considerable importance,
since in this condition the strength of the patient is taxed
by reason of the character of the disease, and the only means
of attaining endurance to carry him through this trying
period is by providing proper nourishment.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The same general outline of diet
is used as in acute infectious fevers, milk forming the basis
of the diet. The patient is given an abundance of water and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>307]</a></span>
other beverages in addition to the other fluid foods to relieve
the thirst which is so often a common symptom in this
disease.</p>

<p>It is sometimes found advisable, however, on account of
the vomiting which may occur, to give a more concentrated
form of nourishment, in which case liquid peptonoids, trophonine,
and panopepton furnish a form of nourishment
which is both strengthening and stimulating in character,
and for these reasons particularly desirable. Freidenwald
and Ruhr&auml;h advise against the use of starches and sugars
in most cases of pneumonia.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Diet Schedule.</strong>&mdash;The same fluid diets used in
acute fevers and administered at two-hour intervals are
advisable here. The following r&eacute;gime is used in pneumonia:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%" summary="Schedule for pneumonia">

<p>The diet may be re&euml;nforced with lactose and meat added
only when convalescence is well established.</p>

<p><strong>Tuberculosis Nursing.</strong>&mdash;The nurse must keep in mind
that the lungs are in a condition more or less out of commission,
and their work of excretion is forced upon the kidneys.
For this reason, as well as on account of the increased
strain upon the heart, it is necessary to keep the diet light
and avoid all foods which may in any way exert an unfavorable
influence upon either the kidneys or the heart.</p>

<p><strong>Milk Diet.</strong>&mdash;A strict milk diet has been found necessary
in certain cases of pneumonia, but this is used only
while the febrile condition lasts, after which the diet is
gradually increased, as in the case of acute nephritis and in
diseases of the heart, to meet the needs of the individual.</p>


<h3>TONSILLITIS</h3>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The diet in this condition is
much the same as that used in other acute febrile conditions,
that is, a fluid diet, the basis of which is, as a rule, milk.</p>

<p>The development of nephritis and certain cardiac symptoms
at times follow attacks of tonsillitis, and for this reason
the urine must be examined frequently and the diet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>310]</a></span>
carefully adjusted to avert, if possible, this danger. When
acute nephritis does follow the attack of tonsillitis, the diet
must necessarily be adjusted to meet that condition rather
than that of the original disease.</p>

<p><strong>Special Diets.</strong>&mdash;The Mosenthal diet, and at times the
Karell Cure, is used with more or less success. This, however,
is adjusted by the physician. It remains for the nurse
to report any unfavorable symptoms as soon as they occur,
and to carry out the line of dietetic treatment deemed advisable
by the physician.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<h4>TUBERCULOSIS</h4>

<p><strong>Form.</strong>&mdash;Acute and chronic in character. The chief
aim of the treatment in the former is to prevent its development
into a chronic form.</p>

<p><strong>Rest.</strong>&mdash;<strong>Sleep</strong>, preferably in the open air, in a tent or
on a sleeping porch.</p>

<p><strong>Proper Surroundings</strong> should be striven for. The patient
should be kept tranquil in mind and body, free from
disturbing worries and assured of the possibility of recovery
with proper care.</p>

<p><strong>Diet</strong> should be adequate without being too abundant;
stuffing the patient is no longer considered necessary, in fact
it is believed that forcing the eating of large quantities of
eggs, etc., defeats its own ends, upsetting the digestion and
causing a disgust for food almost impossible to overcome.</p>

<p><strong>Gastro-intestinal Disturbances</strong> are apt to develop as the
disease progresses. These are treated as in other conditions
so complicated, except that the period of starvation must
necessarily be limited on account of the metabolic waste
already taking place from the disease itself.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>311]</a></span></p>

<h4>PNEUMONIA</h4>

<p><strong>The Lungs</strong>, as in pulmonary tuberculosis, are the seat
of infection and are temporarily hampered in their work of
excretion.</p>

<p><strong>The Kidneys</strong> bear the brunt of the extra work caused by
the impairment of the lungs, consequently all unnecessary
work must be spared these organs if they are to be prevented
from being overtaxed.</p>

<p><strong>Nephritis</strong> is one of the complications apt to develop when
the kidneys are not sufficiently strong to carry on their
own work and that generally done by the lungs.</p>

<p><strong>The Heart.</strong>&mdash;Cardiac symptoms are also likely to develop
during attacks of pneumonia and make the disease
one to be dreaded and guarded against.</p>

<p><strong>The Diet.</strong>&mdash;The dietetic treatment in pneumonia is
like that used in acute infectious diseases, fevers in general,
fluids constituting the form of diet and milk the chief food,
as long as there is an elevation of temperature.</p>


<h4>TONSILLITIS</h4>

<p><strong>The Heart.</strong>&mdash;As in pneumonia, the development of
cardiac symptoms must be guarded against. These symptoms
may not develop at once but show later during or after
convalescence.</p>

<p><strong>The Kidneys.</strong>&mdash;Nephritis also develops in some patients
and the treatment is directed as far as possible to
prevent its developing into a chronic form.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment</strong> is the same as used in acute infectious
conditions, fevers of short duration, taking care to
institute the diet for acute nephritis should the patient
show evidences of this disease.</p>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<br />
DIETETIC TREATMENT BEFORE AND AFTER
OPERATION</h2>

<h3>PREOPERATIVE FEEDING</h3>


<p>The dietetic treatment which is essential before and after
operations is deserving of attention here, since it constitutes
one of the points so frequently overlooked or slighted. As
a rule the treatment depends (1) upon the character of the
disease for which surgical intervention is necessary, and (2)
upon the general health and physical condition of the patient
in question.</p>

<p><strong>Preparatory Treatment.</strong>&mdash;In many cases it is found to
be advisable to build up the patient before subjecting her to
the shock of an operation, and the more serious the operation
the more necessary this &ldquo;building-up&rdquo; process.</p>

<p>The character of the disease also has much to do with
the preliminary diet. In certain pathological conditions involving
the gastro-intestinal tract, for example, the patient
comes to the surgeon after medical treatment has failed to
give relief and surgical intervention is necessary to save
life. The body is found to be in a condition bordering on
starvation, anemic and exhausted from insufficient nourishment.
The functions of the blood-making organs have become
out of gear, as it were, and the blood consequently is
deficient in one or more of its essential elements. For such
patients it is wise to attempt to re&euml;nforce and strengthen
their bodies before operation, that they may have more
endurance to withstand the shock which is more or less
unavoidable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>313]</a></span>
<strong>Adjusting the Diet.</strong>&mdash;In any case where preliminary
diet is prescribed the condition for which the operation is
necessary determines the nature of the diet; for example,
if the operation is to be upon the kidney, the diet beforehand
would naturally be in the nature of a nephritic one
to save the diseased organ unnecessary work. If the
stomach or intestinal tract required surgical care, the diet
would necessarily be formulated to meet the particular
needs of the organ in question, an analysis of the stomach
content furnishing the keynote of the diet. In any case
the food must be simple in character and well prepared.
All food in any way liable to bring about indigestion should
be studiously avoided.</p>

<p><strong>Habits.</strong>&mdash;The habits of the patient must be regulated
so that she may not &ldquo;overdo&rdquo;; at the same time, gentle
exercise may be the very thing needed to give an impetus
to the appetite and thus assist in the adding of strength
for the approaching ordeal. Many patients respond readily
to a change of air and scene and frequent small meals instead
of a few large ones,&mdash;a lunch in the mid-morning and mid-afternoon
hours, consisting of a glass of milk and a cracker
or malted milk chocolate or re&euml;nforced fruit juices. A cup
of warm milk before retiring induces the much-needed
sleep, hence is advisable under the circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>The Bowels.</strong>&mdash;The bowels must be kept open. Coarse
bread such as that made from bran or graham flour is advisable.
Prunes and figs cooked with senna leaves are likewise
simple laxatives which are both palatable and effective.
For stubborn cases of constipation it is often found
that a teaspoonful of a conserve made with a third of a
pound each of raisins, prunes, and figs ground fine, with an
ounce of senna leaves added, taken at bedtime and before
breakfast, will overcome the condition and make the patient
more comfortable and the general health better.</p>

<p><strong>Preliminary Light Diet.</strong>&mdash;The day before the operation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>314]</a></span>
the diet must be light; the intestinal tract must not
be filled with a food mass which is difficult to get rid of.
On the morning of the operation the patient is given no
food if the operation is to be performed at an early hour,
otherwise a cup of tea, coffee, weak cocoa, or broth with a
cracker is given. Some physicians give a glass of milk at
this time, while others do not. It is the physician who must
decide the question if there is any doubt about it. The
stomach must be empty before administering the anesthetic.</p>

<p>In certain emergency operations when it has been impossible
to prepare the patient ahead, the difficulties attending
the administering of the ether are sometimes greatly
increased. The cleansing of the stomach and intestinal
tract oftentimes eliminates or materially decreases the
nausea and vomiting which so often forms one of the most
dreaded sequences of the operation. For this reason many
surgeons require the patient to be given lavage before leaving
the operating room.</p>

<p><strong>Total Abstinence.</strong>&mdash;No food is given for twenty-four
hours following the operation (1) on account of the nausea
and vomiting which so often follows the giving of an anesthetic&mdash;ether
particularly&mdash;and (2) because the entire
organism is better for a complete rest.</p>

<p><strong>Routine Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The routine treatment in uncomplicated
cases is rest, then water, very hot or iced, or
carbonated, or vichy in spoonful doses, then albumen water,
broth, etc., then milk, buttermilk, koumiss, etc., after which
the semi-solids, etc., until a normal diet is reached. After
a week or more the character of the operation certainly
determines the dietetic treatment. To quote Dr. Thomas
S. Brown,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> &ldquo;To give the same diet after pyloroplasty, gastro-enterostomy,
gall bladder operation, or gastric resection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>315]</a></span>
as we would after operations for fracture of the thigh or cancer
of the breast shows a basic ignorance of the pathologic
physiology of the former group of cases.&rdquo; &ldquo;We should
remember that hyperacidity remains long after the underlying
cause has been removed and it is tempting providence,
to say the least, to ply these patients with tomato soup,
salad dressing, and coarse food in the early stages of their
convalescence.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Character of Diet.</strong>&mdash;It must be kept in mind that the
character of the diet is of vital importance, especially in the
after-treatment of operations upon the stomach. In gastro-enterostomy,
for example, the food mass passes from the
stomach directly into the upper part of the small intestine
through the new opening. Thus the semi-liquid food highly
acid in character comes in direct contact with the delicate
intestinal walls which are accustomed, not to the acid, but
to a neutral or alkaline medium.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusting Diet to Disease.</strong>&mdash;Thus it is demonstrated
that unless care is used in selecting the diet this portion of
the intestinal tract will be injured; hence the nurse must
understand which foods are liable to stimulate an excess
flow of acid in the stomach and avoid them. She must
also keep in mind that the foods given must be in a semi-liquid
or very finely divided condition, since the mechanical
efforts made by the musculature of the gastric organ act as
a direct stimulant to the secretory cells of that organ.</p>


<p class="hrpad">Much of the responsibility thus rests upon the nurse
whose business it is to administer the diet. The efforts of
the best surgeon in the world may be entirely overcome by
a careless, thoughtless, or ignorant nurse.</p>

<p><strong>Rectal Feeding.</strong>&mdash;In some cases it is found necessary
to nourish the patient more than is possible by mouth.
This is especially so with emaciated and very weak patients
and for those who have undergone operations upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>316]</a></span>
mouth or throat and in some of the above-mentioned
stomach cases when the passage of any food over the newly-operated-upon
surfaces is inadvisable. In these cases rectal
feeding is resorted to and from two to three nutrient
enemas<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> alternated with saline enemas are given daily.</p>

<p>Under ordinary conditions when the patient has not
been operated upon for gastro-intestinal disorders, gall bladder
or kidney diseases, the dietetic r&eacute;gime is as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Postoperative Feeding.</strong>&mdash;First day: starvation, a little
hot or cold water or carbonated water may be given if there
is no nausea or vomiting. If nausea or vomiting persists, a
few spoonfuls of champagne or clam broth or juice will
often check or relieve it entirely. Fluids alone must be
given during the first forty-eight hours after the operation.
When stimulation is necessary, albumen water or coffee
containing a spoonful of brandy<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> will be found useful.
When nausea entirely disappears, well-skimmed broth
milk, clam or oyster broth, buttermilk, koumiss, malted
milk, may be given. A gradual return to the normal diet is
made, adding soft toast, soft-cooked eggs, junket, ice cream,
meat, wine, or fruit jellies before solid food is introduced
into the dietary.</p>

<p><strong>After-care in Feeding.</strong>&mdash;Care must be observed to prevent
indigestion after almost any operation, but especially
after abdominal operations there is a great tendency to form
gas, hence anything which in any way increases the tendency
may bring about a condition of extreme discomfort
and even acute pain to the patient. For this reason it is
unwise to follow too closely the desires of the patient as
to the food to be eaten; for example, corned beef and cabbage
may be the thing of all others desired by the patient,
but it would be the height of folly to risk such a meal until
all danger of digestional disturbances is at an end. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>317]</a></span>
is wiser to avoid such disturbances than to trust to relieving
them after they occur. The digestion of even a perfectly
normal individual is at a disadvantage when that individual
is deprived of outdoor exercise. How much more so will
it be when the entire organism is taxed by the ordeal
through which it has just passed. Convalescence is never
hastened by imprudent eating, and a condition as bad as
the original may be brought on by lack of care on the part
of the one whose business it is to feed the patient.</p>


<h3>CONDITIONS REQUIRING SPECIAL DIETS</h3>

<p><strong>Diet After Appendicitis.</strong>&mdash;After a simple operation for
appendicitis the same r&eacute;gime is carried out as in stomach
and intestinal operations: fluids on the second day, soft diet
on the third, and solid food of the simplest character and
prepared in the simplest way may be given on the fifth and
sixth days. When, however, the operation has been of a
more serious character, for example, when there was pus
formation or a gangrenous appendix, the feeding by mouth
must not be instituted for five days or more, nutrient
enemas being used instead. Patients have been known to
die from exhaustion after operations upon the stomach and
intestines, not on account of the operation but on account
of the lack of reserve power and endurance to carry them
through the ordeal without a sustaining diet to overcome it.
Under the circumstances Dr. F. Ehrlich<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> advises the following
routine method: &ldquo;So soon as the nausea from the anesthetic
has worn off the patient gets tea, red wine, and gruel;
on the day after the operation he is given sweetbreads in
bouillon even if it nauseates him; if the nausea is persistent,
his stomach is washed. On the second day finely
chopped cooked squab, chicken, or veal, is added; on the
third day, beef, potato pur&eacute;e and cakes; on the fourth,
chopped (raw) ham, soft zwieback, and soft-boiled eggs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>318]</a></span>
On the fifth, white bread and spinach. After the seventh
day the meat is not chopped, and the patient returns gradually
to normal diet. The bowels are regulated by oil
enemas.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Diet After Operation upon Gall Bladder or Liver.</strong>&mdash;The
dietetic treatment in these cases is like that of any
other abdominal operation except for the character of the
food. Fats are not well handled by the body of such individuals
and should be eliminated as far as possible from the
diet. Broths must be skimmed carefully to remove fat, and
milk when given should be skimmed or given in the form
of buttermilk or koumiss.</p>

<p><strong>Diet After Operations upon the Kidneys.</strong>&mdash;The diet
administered after operations upon these organs is logically
one in which those foods which are entirely dependent upon
the kidneys for their elimination are restricted. In a former
chapter the fate of the foods in metabolism was explained;
the protein foods were seen to be the ones leaving the body
chiefly by way of the kidneys and for this reason in the
diet after operations upon these organs, as well as in that
administered in disturbances affecting their functioning
powers, this food constituent, the protein of meat in particular,
must necessarily be restricted. The upsetting of the
nitrogen equilibrium is for so short a period after kidney
operations that this feature need not be considered here.
The diet under the circumstances is essentially the same as
that given during acute attacks of nephritis.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p><strong>Factors Affecting Diet</strong> before and after operations must
be considered under two heads, namely, the character of the
disease for which the operation is considered necessary and
the general physical condition of the patient at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Emaciation and Anemia</strong> are often encountered in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>319]</a></span>
patients having certain gastro-intestinal disturbances for which
surgical intervention was found to be necessary. At times
a preliminary up-building treatment is required before it is
considered wise to submit the patient to the shock of so
serious an operation.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusting the Diet</strong> according to the character of the
disease for which the operation is to be performed is most
important. It is not always possible to build up the body
beforehand, but in many cases it is necessary to make the
effort. At times the re&euml;nforcing of the diet and a certain
amount of gentle massage will enable the patient to pass
through the trying ordeal more comfortably than would
otherwise be possible.</p>

<p><strong>Selecting the Diet</strong> to conform to the character of the
disease is as important a factor in the recovery of the patient
as food itself. This selection is left largely to the nurse,
consequently it is necessary that she should understand
just which foods are indicated or contraindicated under the
circumstances, and adjust the diet after the abstinence
period accordingly. For example, the diet fulfilling all the
needs of a patient who has just undergone an operation for
a broken leg might be highly injurious for a patient just
operated upon for some disturbance of the liver or kidneys.
The diet given after must be essentially like that given just
before the operation, in order that the affected organ may
have an opportunity to heal and return to its normal functioning
power.</p>

<p><strong>Gastro-intestinal Disturbances</strong> must be avoided, both
before and after the operation. In the preliminary treatment,
when every effort is being made to increase the
strength and endurance of the patient, such disturbances do
away with any gain brought about by judicious dieting.
After the operation, attacks of indigestion not only cause
pain and discomfort as a result of the gas formation, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>320]</a></span>
may cause symptoms far-reaching and even dangerous in
their effects. The diet, then, must be composed of the simplest
food and prepared in the most careful manner, the
amount of food given at a time must be small&mdash;it is wiser
to feed the patient oftener than to run the risk of indigestion
by giving more than can be readily handled by the
already taxed digestive apparatus.</p>

<p><strong>The Bowels</strong> must be kept open in the majority of cases.
Peristalsis is stimulated by the giving of water and fruit
beverages as soon as it is advisable to give anything by
mouth.</p>

<p><strong>Re&euml;nforcing the Diet</strong> is at times necessary in order that
the patient&rsquo;s strength may be kept up. In such cases lactose,
eggs and some of the predigested casein or beef preparations
are found to be valuable.</p>

<p><strong>Before the Operation</strong> the patient must be made ready
to take the anesthetic. This is done by preventing an
accumulation of food in the intestinal tract. The day before
the operation, then, it is necessary to limit the diet
materially by giving food in small amounts. The light diets
prescribed in acute conditions are as a rule suitable, unless
otherwise indicated.</p>

<p><strong>The Day of the Operation</strong> a cup of tea, coffee, or broth
may usually be given, with a cracker, unless the operation
is to be performed early in the morning, in which case the
patient is given no food at all. Some physicians allow a
glass of milk on the day of the operation, but this is left
entirely to the physician in charge.</p>

<p><strong>After Operation</strong> a period of total abstinence from both
food and water is necessary in order not to increase or induce
nausea and vomiting. As soon as these symptoms
subside, unless otherwise indicated, a certain amount of hot,
cold, or carbonated water may be given. After this,
albumen water may form the first nutrient administered.
Milk, broth and fruit beverages follow the giving of albumen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>321]</a></span>
water, after which the semi-solids, such as soft eggs,
gelatin and milk soups, constitute the convalescent diet.</p>

<p><strong>The Character of the Diet</strong> after the operation depends
wholly upon the nature of the disease for which the operation
was deemed necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Diet After Gastro-enterostomy</strong> must be adjusted in
order not to increase the acid content of the gastric organ,
otherwise the delicate mucous linings of the intestines would
be subjected to direct contact with materials which are
irritating in character, owing to the fact that the mass
passes through the new opening and has thus been deprived
of the neutralizing agents found in the upper part of the
intestinal tract. Under the circumstances milk, albumen
water and fine cereal gruels are the best foods from which
to formulate the diet after the necessary period of abstinence
and fluid diet.</p>

<p><strong>After Appendicitis</strong>, as a rule, no food is given for five
days in cases where there has been a pus formation and the
appendix gangrenous. Otherwise the routine treatment diet
is given&mdash;water, then albumen water, followed by broth,
milk and fruit beverages, fine cereal gruels, etc.</p>

<p><strong>After Liver and Gall bladder Operations</strong> the character
of the food must be considered. The fats are not well
handled in such conditions and must be avoided as far as
possible. Broths must be well skimmed and the milk fat
free. Buttermilk and koumiss are probably the most suitable
forms in which to give milk in these cases.</p>

<p><strong>After Kidney Operations</strong> the work of elimination
through kidney must be limited as far as possible in such
cases. While it is impossible to rest the organ entirely, the
giving of a proper diet under the circumstances will do much
toward relieving the strain placed upon it. The protein
foods, with the exception of milk, must be excluded from
the diet. The r&eacute;gime practiced in acute nephritis gives the
most satisfactory results.</p>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<br />
URINALYSIS</h2>


<p>The importance of the kidney functions has been clearly
demonstrated. Urine, which is the fluid secreted by these
organs, is one of the most important sources of information,
not only as to the manner in which the body utilizes food
in health, but as an index to certain pathological conditions,
the processes of which are more or less indicated by the
products excreted in the urine.</p>

<p><strong>Function of the Kidneys.</strong>&mdash;The kidneys, as has already
been stated, furnish a means by which the greater part of
the waste products of the body are eliminated and in addition
to this function they adjust the salts in the body. In
an early chapter the function of the salts in food was
explained. A certain amount of these substances, we know,
is absolutely necessary to carry on the work in the body,
but harm comes when a surplus is retained in excess of that
which can be used in performing the various processes.
Consequently the function of the kidneys to adjust the
salts balance is by no means their least important one.</p>

<p><strong>Elimination of the Toxins.</strong>&mdash;The toxic substances manufactured
in the body and those resulting from bacterial
action upon unabsorbed proteins are likewise eliminated in
the urine. Thus it can be readily understood how necessary
it is to keep these organs in good repair, that they may
continue their work in an efficient manner.</p>

<p>It is necessary from a pathological standpoint for the
nurse to understand the making of some of the simpler
tests, that she may simplify her own work and that of the
physician.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>324]</a></span>
<strong>Excretion of Carbon Dioxide and Water.</strong>&mdash;We have
already spoken of the combinations of carbon and hydrogen
compounds. These substances being oxidized, the carbon
dioxide produced is eliminated by way of the lungs and the
water is excreted partly by way of the lungs and skin, but
chiefly by way of the kidneys.</p>

<p><strong>Oxidation and Excretion of Nitrogenous Substances.</strong>&mdash;When
the nitrogenous substances are oxidized, the
used-up oxygen products are eliminated by the kidneys in
the form of urea and more or less highly oxidized substances,
such as ammonia and other salts, purin bases, and
creatinin.</p>

<p><strong>Uric Acid</strong>, the chief of the oxidation products of nucleoproteins,
is produced in the body and from food, and is
always in the urine, being one of its normal constituents.
It is only when this substance is in excess in the urine that
a pathological condition is indicated.</p>

<p><strong>Examination of the Urine</strong>, then, is made for several
different purposes: (1) to ascertain whether the kidneys are
doing their work properly; (2) to find if the kidneys, or any
part of the urinary tract, are either temporarily or permanently
diseased; (3) to be able to judge from the various
substances in the urine whether there is any abnormal
process taking place in the body.</p>

<p><strong>Tests.</strong>&mdash;In the examination of the urine for the above
purposes, certain definite tests are made. These tests differentiate
between the abnormal and the normal.</p>

<p class="lists">
(1) Color.<br />
(2) Amount in twenty-four hours.<br />
(3) Odor.<br />
(4) Specific gravity.<br />
(5) Reaction, acid or alkaline.<br />
(6) Albumen, indican, acetone bodies.<br />
(7) Sugar.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>325]</a></span>
(8) Microscopic examination for casts, cells, bacteria, etc.
</p>

<p><strong>The Color</strong> of normal urine varies, especially with the
amount voided.</p>

<p>The variations in color range from the pale straw color
of individuals who are voiding large quantities to the deep
lemon or amber of those who void much less.</p>

<p>Pathological conditions are indicated to a certain extent
by the color of the urine. Fevers heighten the color, small
quantities of blood cause a smoky appearance, while bile
changes the color of the urine to a greenish yellow.</p>

<p><strong>Precipitates in the Urine.</strong>&mdash;When the urine has been
allowed to stand for a time there is sometimes a brick-red
deposit due to the precipitate of urates. This disappears
upon heating and is not an evidence of any diseased condition.</p>

<p><strong>Turbidity of Urine.</strong>&mdash;The turbidity of fresh urine then
is the only kind which need be considered, since standing
in the cold often brings about this condition, due to the
growth of bacteria and deposits of both phosphates and
urates.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements in Testing Urine.</strong>&mdash;Urine to be tested
should be fresh, and when it is not possible to make the
examination at once it should be preserved with chloroform,
or some other harmless preservative, until ready to use.</p>

<p><strong>Bacteria in Urine.</strong>&mdash;The changes due to bacterial
growth in the urine are manifested not only by the turbid
character of the urine but also by the odor of ammonia.</p>

<p><strong>The Amount of Urine.</strong>&mdash;The amount of urine voided
in twenty-four hours varies with the individual in health
as well as in disease. Many individuals void a great quantity
during the twenty-four hours, chiefly because they
drink a great quantity of water and other beverages. The
average amount of urine passed in twenty-four hours by an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>326]</a></span>
adult, or a child over eight years, is from 1000 to 2000 c.c.
It represents from 60% to 70% of the amount of water
ingested.</p>

<p><strong>Collecting the Urine for Testing.</strong>&mdash;In measuring the
urine it is necessary to begin collecting it after the bladder
has been emptied the first thing in the morning. The patient
should void just before the end of the twenty-four-hour
period to be sure that the amount formed by the kidneys
during this time is accounted for.</p>

<p><strong>Diseases in Which Urine Is Diminished.</strong>&mdash;In certain
diseases the amount of urine passed is diminished. This is
found to be true in diarrhea and dysentery, when water is
lost in the feces, in hemorrhage from any part of the body
and from vomiting. It is likewise at times the case after
abdominal operations and in nervous conditions, such as
hysteria. The urine is diminished when there is an organic
obstruction in the urinary tract and certain obstructive diseases
of the heart, the lungs and the liver. In these latter
cases, there is seen to be a retention or suppression of
urine. In both acute and chronic nephritis and in certain
fevers, the bladder at times must be emptied by means of
a catheter. At other times, the condition is relieved as far
as possible by limiting certain articles of food in the diet.
At any rate, these points must be kept in mind when examining
the urine.</p>

<p><strong>Effect of Food upon the Urine.</strong>&mdash;The odor of normal
urine is changed after eating certain foods, such as onions
and asparagus. In disease, the odor of urine has a distinct
value as a means of diagnosis; cystitis gives a foul odor,
certain bacteria bringing about a decomposition in the urine
and giving rise to an odor of putrefaction. In cases where
there is a fistula connecting the bladder and rectum, the
urine has a fecal odor.</p>

<p><strong>Specific Gravity of Normal Urine.</strong>&mdash;The density or
specific gravity of urine means the weight of any volume of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>327]</a></span>
urine as compared with that of equal volume of distilled
water. The specific gravity of normal urine varies from
1012 to 1024, that is, in a thousand cubic centimeters of
urine there are found from 11 to 18 grams of solid material.
In health it is necessary to know the amount of urine
passed in twenty-four hours, to be able to judge whether the
amount of solids is too high or too low.</p>

<p><strong>Specific Gravity of Diabetic Urine.</strong>&mdash;In conditions like
diabetes mellitus, where there is a wastage of sugar taking
place in the body&mdash;that is, instead of being oxidized to carbon
dioxide and water and glucose, the sugar is passing
into the urine without completing its oxidation&mdash;the
specific gravity rises in these cases to 1030 and over, showing
distinctly that a greater amount of solid material is
in the urine than is present normally. In chronic Bright&rsquo;s
disease and diabetes insipidus, the specific gravity is low.</p>

<p><strong>Method of Determining Specific Gravity.</strong>&mdash;The specific
gravity is determined by the use of an instrument
known as a urinometer. The urine is poured into a tube
and the urinometer is dropped into it. The different figures
are marked upon the stem of the instrument and it is a
simple matter to read off the figures of the level to which
the stem sinks.</p>

<p><strong>Reaction to Litmus.</strong>&mdash;In a former chapter it was stated
that normal urine was, as a rule, acid, that is, it turns blue
litmus red. Certain diseases render the urine alkaline. A
like result is brought about upon the ingestion of sodium
citrate or bicarbonate of soda. Urine which stands and becomes
decomposed is alkaline in reaction, due to the bacterial
action, with the production of ammonia.</p>

<p><strong>Albumen in the Urine.</strong>&mdash;The presence of albumen in
the urine is important, since normal urine does not contain
this material in quantities sufficient to be recognized by
ordinary tests. Hence in disease its presence is an indication
of pathological processes taking place either in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>328]</a></span>
kidney or the urinary passages. The chief abnormal condition
indicated by the presence of albumen in the urine is
nephritis. Traces of albumen may occur in patients with
fever or a heart weakness. Blood and pus in the urine likewise
indicate albumen. When the nephritic condition is
chronic, the kidneys themselves are diseased and the presence
of albumen may be in traces only, while during the
acute attack large quantities may be passed, but the urine
will clear up after a time.</p>

<p><strong>Benedict&rsquo;s Qualitative Sugar Test.</strong>&mdash;Boil 5 c.c. of
Benedict&rsquo;s solution; add 8 drops of urine to be examined;
hold the tube over the flame and allow to boil vigorously
for 3 minutes and set aside to cool of itself. In the presence
of sugar the entire solution will be filled with a precipitate
which may be greenish, yellow, or red, according to the
amount of sugar present. When the percentage of sugar
is low (under 0.3%) the precipitate will form only upon
the cooling of the solution. If there is no sugar present,
the solution will either remain clear or show a slight turbidity,
due to the precipitation of urates. The nurse must
remember that to be useful the test must be made accurately.
There must never be more than 10 drops of urine
and 8 drops is the usual quantity. The boiling must be
vigorous and the solution allowed to cool spontaneously.</p>

<p><strong>Fehling&rsquo;s Test for Sugar.</strong>&mdash;Fehling&rsquo;s alkaline solution
and Fehling&rsquo;s copper solution must be kept in separate bottles
until ready for use. Then about 2 c.c. of Fehling&rsquo;s
alkaline solution is poured into a test tube and 2 c.c. of
Fehling&rsquo;s copper solution is added. This is diluted with
hydrant water to 8 c.c. Half of this quantity is sufficient
for the test. The upper half of the solution is boiled over
flame (gently agitated while heating), and while still boiling
a few drops of urine are added. If no change appears, it is
boiled again and a few drops more of urine are added. If a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>329]</a></span>
reddish precipitate appears, sugar is present. The chemical
reaction taking place is the reduction of copper sulphate to
cuprous oxide. Sometimes a partial reduction occurs when
urates are in excess, but once having seen the real reduction,
a partial one cannot mislead the examiner.</p>

<p><strong>Haines&rsquo;s Test.</strong>&mdash;Pour 1 teaspoonful of Haines&rsquo;s solution
into a test tube and boil gently over a Bunsen burner;
add 6 or 8 drops of urine and again heat to boiling. A yellow
or red precipitate will indicate the presence of glucose.</p>


<h3>QUANTITATIVE TEST FOR SUGAR</h3>

<p><strong>Benedict&rsquo;s Test.</strong><a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>&mdash;The simple quantitative test for
sugar is the one devised by Benedict. This is simpler than
the polariscopic examination and better suited for ordinary
use.</p>

<p>Place 5 c.c. of Benedict&rsquo;s quantitative solution in a
small dish, add a little less than one-fourth of a teaspoonful
of sodium carbonate and one-eighth of a teaspoonful of
talcum and add 10 c.c. of water. Dilute urine (1 part
urine to 9 parts water) except where the qualitative test
showed a low percentage of sugar, that is, when the precipitate
turns green instead of yellow, in which case it will be
unnecessary to dilute the urine. Place dish over burner
and bring the contents to a boil. Pour the urine into a
graduated pipette. Now add the urine drop by drop to
the contents in the dish until the blue color entirely disappears.
This test should be done over several times to
assure an accurate calculation. The calculation is made as
follows: 5 c.c. of Benedict&rsquo;s quantitative copper solution are
reduced by 0.01 gram of glucose, consequently the quantity
of undiluted urine required to reduce 5 c.c. Benedict&rsquo;s solution
contains 0.01 gram of glucose.</p>

water, in other words, 10 times, the calculation would be
5 c.c. diluted urine = 0.5 c.c. actual urine.</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>1500 &times; 0.02 (2 per cent.) = 30 grams of sugar in 24
hours.</p>

<p>Hill and Eckman perform the Benedict&rsquo;s quantitative
test as follows:<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Measure with a pipette 25 c.c. Benedict&rsquo;s solution into
a porcelain dish, add 5 or 10 grams approximately of solid
sodic carbonate, heat to boiling, and while boiling, run in
urine until a white precipitate forms, then add urine more
slowly until the last trace of blue disappears. The urine
should be diluted so that not less than 10 c.c. will be required
to amount of sugar which 25 c.c. of reagent is
capable of oxidizing.</p>

<p>Calculation: 5 divided by number of cubic centimeters
of urine run in equals per cent. of sugar.</p>

<p><strong>Fermentation Test for Quantity of Sugar in Urine.</strong>&mdash;If
the urine is 70&deg; F. (room) temperature when the specific
gravity is taken at both the beginning and end of the test,
it will assure accuracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>331]</a></span>
To 100 c.c. of urine of known specific gravity, add one-fourth
of fresh yeast cake thoroughly broken up. Mix thoroughly
and set aside at a temperature between 85&deg; and
95&deg; F. for twenty-four hours, after which time test with
Benedict&rsquo;s or Fehling&rsquo;s solutions. If reduction is obtained,
it will be necessary to allow the fermentation to continue
until it is complete. When no further reduction is obtained,
the specific gravity is taken after the urine has reached a
temperature of 76&deg;. The difference in the specific gravity
at the beginning and end of the test multiplied by 0.23
gives the percentage of sugar in the urine.</p>

the aid of heat and enough water to make 800 c.c. of mixture.
(Filter, if necessary.) Weigh exactly the copper sulphate
crystals and dissolve in 100 c.c. of water, now add it
to the first solution; stirring constantly. Add the ferrocyanide
solution; cool and dilute to exactly 1 liter.</p>

<p>50 mg. (0.050 gm.) of sugar will reduce 25 c.c. of the
above solution.</p>

<p><strong>Gerhardt&rsquo;s Ferric Chloride Reaction for Diacetic Acid.</strong>&mdash;To
10 c.c. of fresh urine, add carefully a few drops at a
time of undiluted aqueous solution of ferric chloride U.S.P.
A precipitate of ferric phosphates first forms, but upon the
addition of a few more drops of the same solution it is dissolved.
A Burgundy red (red wine) color is obtained in the
presence of diacetic acid. The depth of this color is indicative
of the quantity of acid present. Joslin<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> records the
intensity of the reaction as follows, +, ++, +++, or
++++.</p>

<p>According to Joslin, it must be remembered that similar
reaction is obtained in the urine of individuals taking salicylates,
antipyrin, cyanates, or acetates, but it is a simple
process to differentiate between the color produced as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>333]</a></span>
result of diacetic acid and that produced by the above-mentioned
drugs. If the solution is boiled for two minutes, the
color from diacetic acid will disappear, owing to the unstableness
of that substance, while that from the drugs will
remain unchanged.</p>

<p><strong>Test for Acetone.</strong>&mdash;Pour 5 c.c. of urine to be tested
into a test tube, add a crystal of sodium nitroprusside,
acidify with glacial acetic acid, shake well, and then make
alkaline with ammonium hydrate. The presence of acetone
is indicated by a purple color.</p>


<h3>TESTS FOR ALBUMEN</h3>

<p>The heat test<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> is the simplest. This consists of first
filtering the urine through filter paper, then pouring some
of the clear urine into a test tube, holding the test tube in a
flame so that only the upper layer boils, then adding a few
drops of 2% solution of acetic acid and boiling again. If
there is albumen present, a very faint, or a heavy cloudiness
(precipitate of coagulated albumen) forms on boiling and
persists or becomes heavier on the addition of a few drops
of dilute acetic acid (2%) and boiling again. If a precipitate
occurs at the first boiling, but clears up again entirely
on adding acetic acid, it is not albumen but harmless phosphates
or carbonates.</p>


<h3>HELLER&rsquo;S TEST FOR ALBUMEN</h3>

<p>Into a test tube pour a few drops of nitric acid, filter the
urine and allow a small quantity of it to trickle from a
pipette down the side of a test tube until it comes in contact
with the acid. If albumen is present a distinctly
formed white ring is seen at the zone of contact.</p>


<h3>TEST FOR INDICAN</h3>

<p>This material is found in cases of obstinate constipation
and in other intestinal disturbances where the passage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>334]</a></span>
the food mass in the small intestines is delayed and the
putrefactive bacteria exert their activities upon the unabsorbed
protein.</p>

<p><strong>Test.</strong>&mdash;Mix equal quantities of urine and fresh hydrochloric
acid and add drop by drop fresh concentrated solution
of chloride of lime (5 to 1,000). Indican is indicated
by the appearance of a blue color.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p><strong>Urinalysis</strong> represents one of the most important means
for determining the health of an individual, since it is the
urine that shows those substances produced in the body as
a result of the breaking down of the body tissues and protein
foods.</p>

<p><strong>Composition of Normal Urine</strong> must be familiar to the
nurse in order that she may recognize any change taking
place in the urine of her patient which may indicate pathological
conditions in the body.</p>

<p><strong>The Specific Gravity</strong> of urine is one of the points by
means of which the presence of certain substances more or
less abnormal in character is determined.</p>

<p><strong>Other Points</strong>, such as color, odor, quantity, reaction,
and chemical composition, likewise show any deviation from
the normal in the individual.</p>

<p><strong>Urine Tests</strong> are necessary to determine the composition
of the secretion. The character of these tests and the
methods used in making them form an essential part in
the training of the nurse.</p>

<p><strong>Tests</strong> for the presence of albumen, sugar, and possibly
indican in the urine, should be made by the nurse. The
latter substance represents the extent of putrefaction taking
place in the body and for this reason should be included
in the urine tests.</p>

<p><strong>Collecting the Urine</strong> for testing is important. The
amount includes all that has been voided throughout the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>335]</a></span>
entire twenty-four hours beginning after the bladder has
been emptied on the first morning and ending after the
first specimen has been voided on the morning of the second
day.</p>

<p><strong>Preserving the Urine</strong> for testing is usually necessary,
especially during the warm weather. The specimens
should be collected in a wide-mouthed sterile glass jar.
This should be kept in a cold place. Some harmless preservative
such as chloroform should be added to assure its
keeping.</p>

<br />
ACUTE AND CHRONIC NEPHRITIS</h2>


<p>Nephritis is a disease of the kidneys, in which changes
occur in the tissues of the organs themselves; these changes
may be caused by inflammation of the kidneys and renal
passages brought on as results of the retention of certain
poisonous substances in the blood, or from the action of
specific bacteria. The disease may be acute or chronic in
form and develop as a result of prolonged exposure to cold
and wet, of tonsillitis, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, and to a
less extent of malaria, syphilis, pregnancy, and tuberculosis,
as well as from the effects of certain irritating drugs, such
as cantharides and turpentine.</p>

<p><strong>Directing the Treatment.</strong>&mdash;In any case the treatment
must be directed toward the relief of the acute symptoms
in the beginning and followed up by a general treatment
which will tend to strengthen and relieve the overtaxed
organs and to increase their power to functionate normally.</p>

<p><strong>Causes and Effects.</strong>&mdash;In acute nephritis, the chief
symptoms are uremia, and edema; the urine is materially
diminished in quantity and at times suppressed; it is often
found to be rich in albumen and containing hyaline and
blood casts, red and white blood cells, and various pigments.</p>

<p>In chronic nephritis, which may be the result of an
acute attack, or as a sequel of other diseases already mentioned,
there is seen to be a progressive loss of flesh and
strength, marked anemia, gastro-intestinal disturbances,
increased blood tension and edema, the latter especially in
the face on arising in the morning. Uremia may develop
at any time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>337]</a></span>
<strong>Limiting the Work of the Kidneys.</strong>&mdash;In both acute
and chronic nephritis, great effort must be put forth to
relieve the tax upon the kidneys and to stimulate their
functioning power.</p>

<p>In other diseases, in which definite organs are involved,
the treatment consists chiefly of resting the affected parts
(1) by starvation, (2) by deflecting the work to other
organs when it is possible, chiefly by changing the diet until
the disturbance is overcome. This is generally effectual in
most cases, as has been specially demonstrated in the treatment
of gastro-intestinal diseases.</p>

<p><strong>Problems to Be Considered.</strong>&mdash;But in nephritis, there
are other problems to consider, which make it impossible
to institute such a treatment as will effect a perfect
rest of the renal organs. The kidneys represent the chief
source whereby the waste products of the body are eliminated.
This waste consists not only of the end-products of
the nitrogenous foods ingested, but also the end-products
of tissue metabolism, which is the inevitable result of the
wear and tear of life. Hence, when the functions of the kidneys
are disturbed, these products, often toxic in character,
are retained instead of excreted. Thus instead of forming
normal constituents of the urine they find their way into
the general circulation, exerting a damaging effect upon the
tissues, especially of the kidneys with which they are
brought into such direct contact.</p>

<p><strong>Substances Difficult of Excretion.</strong>&mdash;It has been proved
that the kidneys in nephritis find it difficult to excrete certain
substances, namely, urea, water, salts, and the purin
bodies. Many authorities claim that the uremia manifested
in acute nephritis is the result of the retention of end-products
of the protein metabolism already mentioned and
that the edema is due to a like retention of water and salts.
The greatly diminished quantity of urine voided during the
acute attack would seem to prove this theory. Martin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>338]</a></span>
Fisher,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> however, claims the condition to be due to an acidulation
of the tissues with a consequent osmosis of water,
and directs his treatment to overcome this condition, not by
restricting the quantity of water and salt, as is generally
practised, but by injecting a saline solution into the body in
large quantities with the effect of increasing the flow of
urine by concentrating the salt content of the blood and
therefore its osmotic power. The fluids are withdrawn from
the tissues, thus adding fluidity to the blood stream, which
in turn flushes the kidneys, ridding them of the poisons
which interfere with their normal functioning.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusting the Diet.</strong>&mdash;The uremia and edema must be
relieved. Since it is an undisputed fact, in the majority of
cases, that good results from the regulating of the diet so as
to minimize as far as possible the work of the kidneys, the
various diet cures will be included here.</p>

<p><strong>Milk Cure.</strong>&mdash;Milk, as a rule, forms a basis of most of
the nephritic diets chiefly because of its low salt and protein
content and on account of its non-toxic end-products.</p>

<p>The percentage of water in milk is likewise known and
for this reason the fluid content of a milk diet can be easily
calculated. However, it is also true that the greatest drawback
to a diet consisting solely of milk is the large amount
of water therein compared with its nutrient value.</p>

<p><strong>Resting the Kidneys.</strong>&mdash;During the acute stage of
nephritis the kidneys are given as much rest as possible by
eliminating all food and restricting the amount of water
entering the body. The thirst is relieved by small sips of
plain or carbonated water or by ice pellets held in the
mouth, or, as is sometimes necessary, by injections of water
into the rectum.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusting the Fluids.</strong>&mdash;The amount of fluid, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>339]</a></span>
must be adjusted to meet the condition of the patient, taking
into consideration the amount of urine voided and the
uremic symptoms manifested. If the urine is not suppressed
the amount of water taken may be slightly in excess
of the urine voided, thus promoting diuresis. In many
cases an excellent diuretic drink consisting of one pint of
water and one teaspoonful of cream of tartar with a half a
lemon and perhaps a little sugar, serves the purpose of
relieving the thirst, which is at times acute during this
period.</p>

<p>The extent of the starvation treatment must depend
upon the patient himself. As a rule, however, it is not carried
out longer than two days, after which milk may be
substituted, allowing from twenty to thirty ounces per day,
which is as much fluid as an ordinary nephritic patient can
handle.</p>

<p>The regulation nephritic diet, which is bland in character,
contains nothing that will tend to increase the irritation
and inflammation of the kidneys, and furnishes a certain
amount of nourishment when the symptoms of the disease
warrant the giving of any food other than milk.</p>

hypertension:</p>

<p>Doctors Chase and Rose advise farina used more frequently
than oatmeal, and the plain cream soup, rice or
potato, more often than soups made of celery or asparagus
(the latter used to break the monotony). They also advise
the more frequent use of green string beans and asparagus
in preference to other vegetables.</p>

<p><strong>Elimination of Salt.</strong>&mdash;In many cases of nephritis, especially
those belonging to the parenchymatous type, the kidneys
manifest a difficulty in eliminating salt, and instead of
excreting the normal quantity, find it impossible to eliminate
more than two or three grams or less a day. The retained
salts pass into the fluids of the tissues, giving rise to
or increasing the already existing edema. Tests<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> have been
devised to find the extent of the kidney function to excrete
salt. The following diets are among those commonly
used:<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>341]</a></span>
3 liters of milk (this contains 5 gm. sodium chloride and 100 gm.
protein)</p>

<p class="lists">or</p>

<p>Strauss Diet, consisting of &frac34; liter milk, 4 eggs, 150 gm. bread, and
enough fruit and fruit juice, tea and sugar to make it palatable.
(This diet contains about 3 gm. of salt.)</p>
</div>

<p>If the kidneys are able to excrete the amount of salt
contained in these diets, salt may be added in quantities of
from 5 to 10 grams.</p>

<p><strong>Salt-poor Diets.</strong>&mdash;When the kidneys are unable to
eliminate the normal amount of salt, some of the salt-poor
diets should be advised. Coleman claims,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> however, that
these diets have not fulfilled the promises held out by them.
Coleman groups the salt-poor diets under three headings:</p>

<p>(1) <strong>The strict salt-poor diet</strong>, of which Widal&rsquo;s diet is
an example.</p>

<p>(2) <strong>The medium strict salt-poor diet</strong>, allowing from 2.5
to 5 grams of salt a day. Under this heading the milk diet
was placed, in which 2 to 3 grams of salt is served a day at
table.</p>

<p>(3) <strong>The moderate salt-poor diet</strong>, in which from 5 to 10
grams of salt are allowed each day. In using this diet it is
not necessary to prepare a special menu for the patient, but
take precautions to leave the salt shaker off the tray and
exclude bacon, ham, and other salty foods from the dietary.</p>

<p><strong>Limiting the Amount of Food.</strong>&mdash;It must be kept in
mind that the nephritic condition makes it imperative to
fall below rather than exceed the food requirements of the
individual.</p>

grams; salt-free butter, 40 grams; eggs, 4 to 6. This diet

<h3>KARELL CURE</h3>

<p>Karell has devised the milk cure, which is used possibly
more than any other diet. It not only furnishes a dietary
r&eacute;gime, which is used in nephritis, but it is likewise advocated
in organic diseases of the heart and blood vessels.</p>

<p><strong>Methods of Administering the Karell Cure.</strong>&mdash;The cure
is begun by giving from 3 to 6 ounces of milk three or four
times a day. Karell makes a point of using small quantities
to begin with and having the milk skimmed. The milk is
given at regular intervals, is warmed in winter and given at
room temperature in the summer. It may be given plain or
diluted with limewater. After a week if the stools remain
solid, the daily allowance of milk is increased to two quarts.
Constipation is an indication of the agreement of this diet
and the patient&rsquo;s utilization of the milk. If, however, he
manifests gastro-intestinal disturbances, resulting in diarrhea,
the amount must be temporarily reduced. Karell
advocates boiling the milk and relieving the constipation
with enemas or mild laxatives. The addition of small quantities
of coffee to the morning portion of milk, or of stewed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>343]</a></span>
prunes or a baked apple to the afternoon feeding, also tends
to overcome the condition.</p>

<p><strong>Thirst.</strong>&mdash;The extreme thirst may be relieved by adding
plain water, limewater, or seltzer to the feedings.</p>

<p>If during the second or third week of the cure the hunger
becomes too great for the patient to endure, a small
piece of herring or stale bread may be given.</p>

<p>Once a day a milk soup thickened with a cereal may be
given. The above diet is carried out from five to six weeks,
after which the patient is gradually returned to a normal
diet. Milk, however, should still constitute an important
part of the diet. The Karell cure is modified more or less
to meet the condition of the patient, the amount of milk
administered in some cases being more and in others considerably
less than mentioned in the above r&eacute;gime.</p>

<p><strong>Limiting the Proteins.</strong>&mdash;The extent of the damage
caused by the end-products of protein metabolism cannot
be easily estimated, but it is wise not to err on the side of
an over-supply, since the retaining of these materials in the
body gives rise to a certain type of intoxication (uremic
poisoning).</p>

<p><strong>Relative Toxicity of the Animal Proteins.</strong>&mdash;The difference
between the various animal proteins as to their
relative toxicity has been the subject of much discussion.
As far as their nutrient value is concerned, they are practically
the same, that is, the protein of beef and the protein
of chicken show very similar analyses. The beef contains,
however, more extractives, which we know are high in
purins. These substances have proven detrimental to the
welfare of a nephritic patient.</p>

<p><strong>Selection and Preparation of Foods.</strong>&mdash;For this reason
the so-called red meat is sometimes boiled instead of roasted,
as the latter mode of preparation increases the formation of
purins on the brown outer surfaces of the meat. Chicken
and fish contain less purin bases and for this reason are often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>344]</a></span>
included in the diet when beefsteak and lamb chops are excluded.
Meat soups and broths contain little nutrient value,
consisting as they do chiefly of water, salt, and extractives,
all of which are looked upon with disfavor, and classed with
the offending articles of food in the nephritic diet. Cream
soups, except bean or pea soup,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> may be given in moderation.
They are non-toxic in character and of high nutrient
value, furnishing a valuable addition to the diet when the
gastro-intestinal symptoms permit of such addition.</p>

<h3>CHRONIC NEPHRITIS (BRIGHT&rsquo;S DISEASE)</h3>

<p>Chronic nephritis may develop as a sequel to an acute
attack, and an individual suffering from chronic nephritis
may at any time develop acute symptoms. In any case the
dietetic treatment would necessarily have to be made to
cover the existing symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;In cases where the patient has
entirely recovered from uremia but still manifests symptoms
of water and salt retention, the diet would be naturally
directed to cover the latter, at the same time taking
care not to strain the weakened functions by giving more
food than could be readily handled. The water and salts
still have to be restricted, but a certain amount of fat and
carbohydrate with small additions of nitrogenous food materials
may be added from time to time as the kidneys show
improvement. It must be borne in mind, however, that at
this time it is very easy to overtax the renal organs and it
is safer to err on the side of under rather than over feeding.</p>

<p>The logical treatment, therefore, consists of utilizing the
improved functions while those still failing to react are getting
further rest.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusting the Proteins in Diet.</strong>&mdash;If the individual
shows a definite anemia, as is often the case after acute attacks,
either as a result of the disease itself or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>347]</a></span>
necessarily low diet, which the acute symptoms of uremia and
edema made necessary, other measures are necessary to
bring the body back to a normal condition. It has been
found that in these cases where there has been no permanent
damage to the renal organs, but merely a temporary impairment
of the functioning power, the treatment must be,
first, a rest to the affected parts; second, the temporary
restriction of all articles of food which impose a tax on the
kidneys to eliminate; the third, the gradual return to normal
diet as the acute symptoms decrease and the function
of the kidneys no longer shows impairment. Such a case is
cited by Strouse and Perry<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> as occurring in the Michael
Reese Hospital. Mr. X. recovered from the acute stage of
nephritis and all signs of edema and uremia disappeared;
the man was kept on a low salt and low protein diet for a
long time. His urine was clearing up, but he did not feel
up to standard and remained anemic. Thinking in all probability
that his symptoms were due to a low protein diet,
meat was slowly added to his dietary until he was receiving
60 grams of protein a day. There was an immediate general
improvement in his condition with no increased renal disturbance.
It is an obvious fact that chronic nephritis, like
any other chronic condition, requires a different method of
treatment from that practised to relieve the acute stage.
The very fact that it is chronic proves that the strenuous
methods are neither necessary nor wise.</p>

<p><strong>Testing the Kidney Functions.</strong>&mdash;The authorities of
to-day endeavor to ascertain the extent of the damage to
the renal organ by testing its functioning power. These
renal function tests have been the subject of much interest
and investigation. Probably the ones most commonly employed
are those devised by Hedinger and Schlayer<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and
adapted for use in the Johns Hopkins Hospital by Mosenthal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>348]</a></span>
<strong>Diets Used in Tests.</strong>&mdash;The diet employed in making
these tests consists of different amounts of certain substances
known to be diuretic in character. This diet is
rigidly adhered to and a careful analysis of the urine passed,
the total quantity and specific gravity of each specimen
made and in this way the various functions of the kidneys
and the impairment thereof are tested. Thus an intelligent
adjustment of the diet may be made.</p>

<p><strong>Renal Functional Tests.</strong>&mdash;The following schedule is
used by Mosenthal, of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, in
making what is known as the &ldquo;Two-Hour Test for Renal
Function&rdquo;:</p>

On two days previous to the test the patient usually had
a diet containing 2000 calories, 75 grams of protein, 4 grams
of sodium chloride.</p>

<p>The test diet is a mixed diet containing known amounts
of water, nitrogen, and chloride, together with the food
diuretics (purins, salt, and water), as can be seen. The
diet is divided into unequal portions containing known but
varying amounts of fluid, nitrogen, and salt. Two-hour
specimens are collected from 7 <small>A.M.</small> to 9 <small>P.M.</small>, and one night
specimen is obtained containing all the urine passed between
9 <small>P.M.</small> and 7 <small>A.M.</small> Each specimen is analyzed for volume,
specific gravity, total nitrogen, nitrogen concentration,
total chloride, and chloride concentration.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of Tests.</strong>&mdash;The purpose of the test is to find
out to what extent and in what manner the diseased kidney
under stimulation by the various diuretics taken in the food
reacts in putting out the varying amounts of salt.</p>

Added Urea and Salt Test</strong>, which was first described by

<p>Patient is given 75 grams of protein, 4 grams of sodium
chloride, and 1500 c.c. of water, with a caloric value of from
2000 to 2200 calories. After the output of fluid, salt and
nitrogen reaches an equilibrium on this diet on one day 10
grams of additional salt is given and several days later the
patient receives 20 grams of urea. This order may be reversed.
The daily output of urine, salt, and nitrogen is
determined and charted. After the salt and nitrogen is
added to the diet in normal individuals, their excretion after
forty-eight hours returns to its previous level. In diseased
kidneys this may not be the case.</p>

<p><strong>Value of Tests.</strong>&mdash;Thus it is seen that in these tests for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>352]</a></span>
kidney functions, an effort is made to determine the extent
of damage wrought by the disease upon the renal organs and
the manner in which they react under definite circumstances.
However, it is not so simple as it would seem to
formulate a dietary based on the findings resulting from
the renal tests. Notwithstanding this, these tests are coming
more and more into use, both in hospitals and private
practice, and a nurse must understand just how they are
carried out, and must realize that unless her part is performed
with absolute accuracy the entire value of the test
will be obliterated. Too much stress cannot be laid upon
this phase of the test, if it is to be of any value whatsoever
in determining the condition of a diseased kidney.</p>


<h3>CHRONIC INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS</h3>

<p>This form of nephritis is more insidious in character,
developing more slowly and manifesting different characteristics,
than those seen in some of the other types already
mentioned. The condition is, as a rule, associated with
heart symptoms and high blood pressure. The blood shows
an increase in urea and other end-products of protein
metabolism, whereas there is no manifest change in the
metabolism of salt or water. The great increase in volume
of urine voided would show an inability on the part of the
kidneys to eliminate a highly concentrated urine. This
hypothesis is further demonstrated in the urine tests.</p>

<p><strong>Urinalysis.</strong>&mdash;Upon analysis the urine in these cases
shows less albumen and fewer casts than found in other
types of nephritis. The disease is manifested by slight
headache, gastric disturbances, and a frequent desire to
urinate.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The treatment here depends
upon the extent of the impairment of the functions of the
kidney. If the damage is not extensive and the diagnosis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>353]</a></span>
has been sufficiently early to insure prompt improvement
upon treatment, the diet is so directed as to prevent the occurrence
of any of the acute symptoms. The patient is
warned against overeating and drinking, over-exercise and
nervous excitement. When it is possible, a change to a
warm, dry climate is advisable with more rest and sleep and
less work and worry. He is advised to eat less at meals and
if hungry to eat a light lunch of milk or buttermilk with
crackers in the mid-morning. The same dietary precautions
must be taken in these disturbances as in other nephritic
conditions, keeping always in mind the fact that the kidneys
are the chief organs of excretion in the body, and through
them must pass the majority of all end-products of nitrogen
metabolism.</p>

<p><strong>Limiting the Nitrogen.</strong>&mdash;The nitrogenous foods cannot
be eliminated entirely, especially if, as is often the case,
the individual suffers from chronic nephritis and is up and
about attending to business; but they can be judiciously
regulated in the diet. All such foods as fried foods, rich
pastries, rich sauces and gravy, spices of all kinds, tea and
coffee, celery and asparagus, must be avoided.</p>

<p><strong>Limiting the Fluids.</strong>&mdash;von Noorden limits the amount
of fluid to 1&frac14; liters per day. This does not include the
water content of the various foodstuffs. He advises a period
of observation to determine the amount best suited to the
condition of the patient and reducing this amount from 250
to 150 c.c. a day until the desired quantity is reached. He
advises a drinking day once a week, allowing the patient to
drink as much water as he likes.</p>

<p><strong>Development of Uremia.</strong>&mdash;Whenever evidences of
uremia appear the treatment must be changed to meet the
condition. It is necessarily more strenuous than that used
ordinarily in the chronic nephritis. If the uremia becomes
positive, then the treatment laid down for acute nephritis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>354]</a></span>
already described must be at once instituted. The patient
must be put to bed at once and every effort made to assist
the body in getting rid of the causes.</p>

<p>In certain cases of nephritis, in which uremic poisoning
is due to the retention of the end-products of nitrogen
metabolism, or to the toxins formed as a result of the tissue
changes due to the disease, the water then instead of being
restricted in the dietary is greatly increased to encourage
a free diuresis with a consequent washing out of the accumulated
poison. Certain authorities recommend a strict
milk and water diet, as has already been described in the
beginning of the chapter. A light or soft diet is advised
until the condition improves, resting the renal organs as
far as possible. This diet may consist of fruit juices,
strained cereals with cream, cocoa, milk, buttermilk, toast,
butter, strained apple sauce, cream soups, except those made
with beans or peas. The above diet is gradually increased
by adding a mashed or baked potato, well-cooked green
vegetables, stewed or raw fruit, rice and tapioca pudding,
and chocolate blanc-mange.</p>

<p><strong>Selection and Preparation of Food.</strong>&mdash;The preparation
of foods for the nephritic differs in certain particulars from
that used in other pathological conditions, namely, the restriction
of certain food constituents; dishes made with
meat and eggs are cut out of the diet, and salt is used as
sparingly as possible, when it is used at all. The nurse must
weigh or measure out the maximum quantity allowed and
divide this in portions for each feeding, measuring carefully
any that is not used and charting it. In this way it is possible
to increase or decrease the amount according to the
symptoms of the individual. The water content of the various
foods comprising the diet is, as a rule, not considered,
but it is necessary to adhere strictly to the orders of the
physician and to curtail the beverages, water, tea, coffee,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>355]</a></span>
etc., until the amount conforms to that laid down in the
dietary.</p>

<p>The nitrogenous foods, with the exception of milk, are
as a rule eliminated from the nephritic diet. The nurse
must study the tables and learn which food materials come
under this head. It may seem difficult to prepare diet for
the sick without eggs, but it is possible and at times obligatory.</p>

<p><strong>Combating Anemia.</strong>&mdash;In chronic (ambulatory) nephritis
the anemia must be reckoned with. It is not safe to
upset the nitrogen equilibrium of the body, but it has been
proved that this may be maintained on as little as 30 or 40
grams of protein a day. This will be seen not to be difficult
to obtain when milk forms an important part of the diet.
The wheat and oat cereals, as well as the bread, contain
protein, and a judicious use of these foods will enable the
nurse to give her patient the necessary quantity to offset, in
a measure, the anemia which is at times most troublesome.</p>

<p><strong>Advice to Patient.</strong>&mdash;One important point must be observed
by the nurse and impressed upon the patient when
he leaves her care. This is moderation in the amount of
food eaten. The kidneys must never be overtaxed, even
with foods which in themselves seem harmless. As danger
lies in overindulgence, this point cannot be too strongly
emphasized.</p>

<p><strong>Advice to the Nurse.</strong>&mdash;The use of the formulas included
in this text is left to the discretion of the nurse. In
those calling for seasoning, such as pepper, mustard, etc.,
the condiments must be omitted. A small amount of celery
salt may be substituted in certain instances if the dish is
unpalatable without something of the kind. In cases where
the salt is restricted the dishes are prepared as directed, with
the exception of the salt. The recipes calling for eggs and
meat are not to be used unless directed by the physician.
Cornstarch, sago, and tapioca may be used instead of gelatin.

The following menus may be used as guides in selecting
foods to prepare for the nephritic patient after the rigid

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p><strong>The kidneys</strong> find difficulty in eliminating certain substances,
namely, the end-products of protein metabolism&mdash;urea,
water, salts, and purin bodies.</p>

<p><strong>The Urine</strong> constitutes the chief point of investigation.
Analysis shows the presence of albumen, casts, blood cells,
and pigments, with a corresponding deficiency in the normal
constituents, water, urea, and salts.</p>

<p><strong>Volume of Urine.</strong>&mdash;The volume of urine is reduced,
and at times suppressed, owing to the difficulty with which
the kidneys eliminate water in nephritic conditions.</p>

<p><strong>The Blood</strong> shows the presence of the toxic substances
on account of the inability of the kidneys to eliminate them
properly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>361]</a></span>
<strong>Edema</strong> is a common symptom and is probably due to
the retention of salts and water by the tissues of the body.
It is treated and at times relieved by limiting the intake of
fluids and reducing the amount of sodium chloride in the
diet.</p>

<p><strong>Uremia</strong> is the most dreaded symptom and develops as a
result of the retained toxins in the blood. Its development
is prevented, if possible, by reducing the amount of fluid
and food, even of milk, in the diet.</p>

<p><strong>Uremic Poisoning</strong> is an acute intoxication due to the
abnormal retention of these poisons and the inability of the
kidneys to eliminate them. It is combated by instituting a
starvation treatment which is followed by the above-mentioned
restricted diet.</p>

<p><strong>Gastro-intestinal Disturbances</strong>, especially diarrhea, are
apt to develop in chronic nephritis. Care must be taken to
keep the meals small in size, simple in proportion, and constituted
only from the allowed foods.</p>

<p><strong>Anemia</strong> follows the acute attack and is especially noticeable
in those cases in which a rigid starvation r&eacute;gime
has been found necessary. It may likewise be the result of
a long-continued diet in which the proteins have been reduced
to the lowest possible amount. The simple proteins
in the diet must, at times, be increased and the patient advised
to take plenty of fresh air and sunshine, in order to
overcome this progressive anemia.</p>

<p><strong>Restrictions</strong> in the diet are essential. These consist of
limiting the amount of food and fluids as well as the type of
food ingested.</p>

<p><strong>Restricting the Proteins.</strong>&mdash;Proteins are restricted on
account of the difficulty with which the end-products are
eliminated by the kidneys, also on account of the toxic
character of these substances.</p>

<p><strong>Restricting the Fluids.</strong>&mdash;It is necessary, on account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>362]</a></span>
their difficulty of elimination and because they impose an
excessive tax upon the circulatory organs.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong> is largely dietetic in character by reason of
the advantages just mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>Starvation Treatment</strong> is instituted in order that the
work of the kidneys may be lessened. This treatment consists
of abstinence from food with a definite reduction in the
fluid intake. It is found to be necessary during the acute
stage of the disease.</p>

<p><strong>Extreme Thirst</strong>, which is apt to be an annoying symptom
at this time, is relieved, as far as possible, with small
sips of water or ice pellets held in the mouth.</p>

<p><strong>Nephritic Cures</strong> are devised, as far as possible, to relieve
the acute symptoms and to prevent the disease from developing
into a chronic condition. Milk is the basis of most
of these cures. It is given in definite amounts at stated
intervals; the quantity and frequency with which it is given
being adjusted to the state of the disease and the condition
of the patient.</p>

<p><strong>The Karell Cure</strong> is one of the best known diet cures used
in the relief of acute nephritis. It consists of the giving of
skimmed milk three or four times a day in doses ranging
from three to six ounces for one week, at the end of which
time, provided the stools remain solid, an increase to two
quarts a day is made.</p>

<p><strong>Constipation</strong> under the circumstances is a favorable
symptom, indicating as it does the agreement of the milk.</p>

<p><strong>Diarrhea</strong> as a result of gastro-intestinal disturbances has
directly the opposite indication. In these cases the milk
must be reduced. Karell advises the boiling of milk and
relieving the constipation by means of mild laxatives or
enemas.</p>

<p><strong>Duration of the Karell Cure</strong> is from four to six weeks,
after which a gradual return to a normal diet is made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>363]</a></span>
<strong>Hunger</strong> is apt to be prominent at this stage of the treatment
and is relieved during the second or third week by
giving a small piece of dry bread and milk, soup thickened
with a cereal, once a day.</p>

<p><strong>Functional Kidney Tests</strong> are made to determine the
character and extent of the impairment of the functions of
the kidneys. The diets used in these tests contain definite
amounts of certain diuretic substances, and the analysis of
the urine voided during the twenty-four-hour period required
by the test shows the nature of the impairment and
furnishes, in a measure, a means of determining the amount
of food and fluid which is safe for the patient to take. It
likewise shows the extent to which the restrictions in the
salt and proteins are necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Salt-free, or Salt-poor Diets</strong> are necessary in some cases.
While restriction in the amount of salt used in the preparation
of food for the nephritic patient is always advisable,
if there is a tendency to edema, the salt shaker should be
left off the tray, and when there is a definite amount of salt
prescribed, it should be weighed or measured for the day
rather than for the meal, and the amount consumed recorded
after each feeding.</p>

<p><strong>Special Points</strong> for the nurse to remember are the necessity
for an early recognition of unfavorable symptoms&mdash;of
instructing the patient upon leaving her care in the need for
keeping the size of the meals small;&mdash;of the danger of
indulging in alcoholic or other stimulating beverages;&mdash;of
eating highly spiced foods, or of eating anything which may
cause gastro-intestinal disorders.</p>

<p>She should emphasize the need for regular examination
of the urine and the value of rest and freedom from nervous
excitement, and the need of living in the sunshine as much
as possible.</p>

<p>The nurse should study the diet list and become familiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>364]</a></span>
with the foods allowed and those to be avoided. The tables
show the foods which are rich in salts and proteins. She
should likewise understand and be able to make the simple
test for albumen in the urine and the method of collecting
the urine for the test made in the laboratory.</p>

<br />
DISEASES OF THE HEART</h2>


<p>The dietetic treatment in diseases of the heart has been
the subject of much study, especially during the past few
years.</p>

<p><strong>The Diet.</strong>&mdash;In this pathological condition, as in many
other diseases in which one or more of the functions of the
body have become impaired, there can be no hard and fast
rule covering the treatment or diet for all cases, but, as in
nephritis, the condition of the individual, his symptoms,
and the progress and extent of the disease must be taken
into consideration in order to formulate a diet calculated to
adequately nourish the body, while at the same time imposing
the smallest amount of work with the least expenditure
of labor upon the part of the diseased organ.</p>

<p><strong>Division of Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The treatment of the disease
then may be said to be divided into three stages: first, the
stage of compensation; second, that of moderate compensation;
third, that of decompensation. The diet is directed,
first, toward relieving as far as possible the strain which is
imposed more or less by all the food eaten; and second,
keeping up the general nutrition of the body.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;No matter what has caused the
impairment of the heart functions, the treatment must
necessarily remain the same as far as diet is concerned.
The patient is no longer able to handle a full and unrestricted
diet. As long as compensation is good, the restrictions
are scarcely noticeable; alcoholic beverages and possibly
tobacco may have to be, to a certain extent, curtailed,
and in some cases avoided altogether. However, if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>366]</a></span>
individual desires to live and be comfortable while so doing,
he must lead a wholesome, simple life, since he cannot with
safety indulge in any excesses, either in diet or in any other
particular.</p>

<p><strong>Diet in Second Stage.</strong>&mdash;When the second stage sets in,
that is, when the heart muscle is unable to perform its normal
function, attention must be directed toward two main
points; first, the work of the heart; second, the pressure
upon that organ from other sources, namely, the stomach
and intestines. As long as the food does not disagree, that
is, so long as there is no fermentation or putrefaction of the
food material in the stomach and intestines the flatulence
arising from the evolution of gas in those organs is slight
and the pressure upward upon the heart inconsiderable.</p>

<p><strong>Restricting the Fluids.</strong>&mdash;The heart must be spared all
unnecessary work. This can only be accomplished by limiting
the amount of food and fluids ingested. The latter imposes
an extra burden upon the impaired organ to eliminate.
Consequently, the amount of fluid should be limited to 1500
c.c. a day at most, and in many cases considerably less than
that quantity.</p>

<p><strong>Regulating the Meals.</strong>&mdash;The meals should be small and
the intervals of feeding regular. It has been found best to
give the fluids between meals rather than with the food.
In many cases of heart disease, as in certain nephritic conditions,
edema is a prominent symptom, so that it is necessary
to direct our efforts toward overcoming that particular
condition. The Karell Cure<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and the salt-poor diet are used
with excellent results. The latter is not so low as the
former, and in many cases will accomplish all that is required.
A modified Karell diet is used in the Michael Reese
Hospital<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> in Chicago as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>367]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;MODIFIED KARELL TREATMENT&rdquo;<br />

(Salt-free)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milk 200 c.c. at 8 <small>A.M.</small>, 12 <small>M.</small>, 4 <small>P.M.</small>, and 8 <small>P.M.</small>, for five
to seven days.</p>

<p>Eighth day&mdash;Milk same as above.</p>

<p class="lists">10 <small>A.M.</small> one soft egg; 6 <small>P.M.</small> 2 slices of dry toast.</p>

<p>Ninth day&mdash;Milk as above.</p>

<p class="lists">10 <small>A.M.</small> one soft egg and 2 slices of toast.</p>

<p>Tenth to twelfth day&mdash;Milk as above.</p>

<p class="lists">12 <small>M.</small> chopped meat, rice boiled in milk, easily digested vegetables.</p>

<p class="lists">6 <small>P.M.</small> one soft-boiled egg.</p>

<p>The diet is gradually increased until a full tray is
reached. All meats and vegetables should be chopped or
scraped at first, and the heavier foods should be given only
when the heart is practically compensated.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Rules and Regulations.</strong>&mdash;There are a few general rules
which it has been found advisable to impress upon individuals
suffering from a disease in which the muscles of the
heart have become weakened. The compensation of the
organ may improve, but there is still a danger of a reoccurrence
or a further development more or less serious, and
at times fatal. So for this reason, certain rules must be observed
throughout life:</p>

<p>First: the necessity for keeping the meals small, simple,
and digestible. Death at times occurs with symptoms of
gastric disturbance, which is, after all, due to the heart.
Consequently it is not wise to invite such disaster by overeating,
or by the partaking of any food which is liable to
bring about indigestion, either in the stomach or in the intestines.
Most authorities advise four or five meals a day
rather than the regulation three, and limit the fluids at
meal time to a few ounces only, when any are allowed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>368]</a></span>
to a maximum amount of 1500 c.c. during the day, chiefly
between meals.</p>

<p>Second: the need for limiting the amount and type of
exercise taken, especially after eating, since the work of
digestion requires all the power and strain of which the
heart is capable, and since an additional tax placed upon it
by muscular exertion might readily be just the final straw,
the added fraction which weighs down the balance on the
scale of life.</p>

<p>Third: the advisability of abstaining from alcoholic
beverages, unless specially prescribed by the physician in
charge.</p>

<p>Certain elderly people suffer from a condition known as
senile heart, which is more or less associated with arteriosclerosis
and high blood pressure. These individuals should
be prevailed upon to take the precaution of regulating their
habits of life, avoiding excesses of all kinds, not only on account
of the weakened condition of the heart, but also on
account of the condition of the arteries. They should avoid
excitement and worry, since the very fact that they are
worrying increases the blood pressure. Simple foods in
limited quantities, five meals a day instead of three, and an
avoidance of too much fluid, should be the keynote of their
daily r&eacute;gime.</p>

<p>Tact on the part of the nurse is necessary in all cases,
both young and old. It is often more difficult to instill good
dietary habits in heart patients, after acute symptoms have
subsided, than to carry them out during the acute attack,
when the life itself depends upon a rigid adherence to the
diet prescribed. But as these rules and regulations are essential
to the future welfare of the patient, he must be taught
with care, and in such a way that he will not be alarmed to
an extent when more harm than good will come of the
teaching.</p>

<p>The diet should consist chiefly of milk, eggs, rare meat in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>369]</a></span>
moderation (mutton, chicken, fish, and oysters), well-baked
bread, well-cooked cereals, potatoes and green vegetables,
and simple desserts. All foods which in any way cause
gastric or intestinal disturbances must be avoided. If these
disturbances arise during the course of the disease, the
patient should be promptly returned to the strict milk diet.
When edema is prominent, it is treated as already described
in the treatment for the like condition in nephritis by the
Karell or salt-free diet.</p>

<p>The dietetic treatment given here is merely a guide to
be used under certain conditions. The physician formulates
the diet, and the nurse must understand what to expect
and how to apply the treatment as the symptoms arise.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment</strong>, adjusted to relieve the weakened
heart muscles and to save the organ from all possible strain.</p>

<p><strong>Three Stages</strong>, during which the treatment changes according
to the extent and progress made by the disease.</p>

<p>First Stage: The diet is practically normal. Compensation
is good, consequently no dietary measures save the limiting
of alcoholic beverages are necessary.</p>

<p>Second Stage: The compensation is only moderate and the
heart cannot perform its normal functions, hence the diet must
be directed toward relieving any pressure upon the organs from
other organs and toward lessening the work of the heart itself.</p>

<p>Third Stage: In which the compensation is decidedly
impaired and for this reason the dietetic treatment undergoes
a decided change.</p>

<p><strong>Digestional Disturbances</strong> in which there is an evolution
of gas in the stomach or intestines may cause a pressure
against the heart which is distinctly bad for it.</p>

<p><strong>Limiting the Fluids</strong> in the diet in heart disease is necessary
when the compensation is only moderate, as they impose
an extra burden upon the organ to eliminate them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>370]</a></span>
<strong>Amount of Food</strong> must also be limited. The meals must
be small and taken without fluid. The latter should be
taken between meals.</p>

<p><strong>Edema</strong> occurs in a number of cases and must be treated
as in nephritic conditions by limiting the fluids and by confining
the diet to &ldquo;salt-poor&rdquo; foods.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p><strong>Karell Cure</strong> or modification thereof has been used with
good results in many cases of heart disease.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong> must be limited in amount and confined to
types which will not impose a tax upon the weakened heart
muscles. Exercise after eating is especially to be discouraged,
as this, together with the efforts required for the digestion
of food, might readily prove too much for the heart to
accomplish.</p>

<p><strong>Elderly Patients</strong> must be warned against exercises of all
kinds, not only on account of the condition of the heart,
but also on account of the condition of the arterial walls.
These harden with age and break down under undue pressure.</p>

<p><strong>The Nurse</strong> should instruct the patient on the points
necessary for the saving of the heart. She should teach the
necessity for keeping the meals small and having them more
frequently if necessary; of limiting the fluids at meals to a
few ounces or leaving them out altogether at this time.
She should know how necessary is the reduction of the fluid.
She should also warn against the taking of alcoholic beverages
except with the permission and advice of a physician.</p>

<p><strong>Excitement and Worry</strong> increase the blood pressure,
hence must be avoided by individuals suffering with any
form of heart disease.</p>

<br />
DIABETES MELLITUS</h2>


<p><strong>Definition.</strong>&mdash;Diabetes is a disease which is characterized
by an inability on the part of the body to utilize the
carbohydrates, in consequence of which there is abnormal
excretion of glucose in the urine.</p>

<p><strong>Sugar in the Urine.</strong>&mdash;The appearance of sugar in the
urine may not necessarily signify diabetes, it may be merely
a temporary glycosuria due to certain pathological conditions,
such as infectious diseases, diseases or trauma which
affect the pancreas, and which disappear upon the recovery
from the disease. But any appearance of sugar in the urine
should be looked upon with suspicion, since the future welfare
of the patient depends largely upon an early diagnosis
in any form of diabetes.</p>

<p><strong>True Diabetes.</strong>&mdash;Allen claims that true diabetes may
always be distinguished from nervous glycosuria by the application
of the laws governing these conditions (Allen&rsquo;s
Paradoxical Law<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>), which is &ldquo;whereas in normal individuals
the more sugar given the more is utilized, the reverse is
true in diabetes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Manufacture of Sugar from Other Foods.</strong>&mdash;If the
carbohydrate foods alone caused all the trouble in diabetes,
the disease might be more easily controlled. This, we found,
however, not to be true, since in certain conditions the body
utilizes the protein foods for the manufacture of glucose
also. Consequently in diabetes if the absolute sugar output
of the body is to be controlled, the intake of nitrogenous
foods must be likewise adjusted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>372]</a></span>
<strong>Functions of Carbohydrates.</strong>&mdash;In the chapter describing
the functions of the carbohydrates in the human body
it was demonstrated that their energy-producing properties
did not cover the extent of their usefulness. It has been
proved that this food constituent normally acts as neutralizing
agent for the toxic acids produced within the organism
as a result of the breaking down of the <em>fats</em>. Hence, when
this function of the carbohydrates becomes impaired, these
acids, Oxybutyric acid, Diacetic acid and Acetone, fail to be
neutralized and are consequently absorbed into the blood
stream, giving rise to a form of intoxication known as acidosis.
When acidosis becomes extreme, the diabetic patient
is apt at any time to succumb to the dreaded diabetic coma.</p>

<p><strong>Keeping Urine Sugar Free.</strong>&mdash;Thus it is seen that the
treatment of diabetes mellitus consists not alone of freeing
the urine from sugar and keeping it free, but of controlling
the acidosis which may at any time develop.</p>

<p><strong>Diabetic Cures.</strong>&mdash;Numberless so-called diabetic cures
have been brought forward and more or less tested for years,
but whether they have really accomplished cures has not
been satisfactorily proved. Not until Dr. Allen instituted
what is known as the Allen&rsquo;s Starvation Treatment has the
disease been so universally treated, at least by one method
or modification of one method. Dr. Joslin, who has used
this treatment most successfully, does not claim to have
accomplished a cure, but states that he is watching the
results of the treatment in his patients with interest.</p>

<p><strong>Starvation Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The Allen Starvation Treatment
consists of first a period of about forty-eight hours in
which the patient is given an ordinary diet, during which
time the daily weight is taken and the urine examined and
recorded.</p>

<p><strong>Acidosis.</strong>&mdash;It has been found in some cases, such as
with elderly patients or those in whom there is an evident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>373]</a></span>
acidosis, advisable to precede the period of starvation by a
preliminary treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Method of Treatment.</strong>&mdash;Joslin<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> suggests the following
method of procedure:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without otherwise changing the diet omit fat. After
two days, omit protein, then halve the carbohydrates daily
until the patient is taking only ten grams, then fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the Michael Reese Hospital, the following series of
test diets are given to determine the severity of the diabetes:</p>

<p>The Test Diets are designed for the period during which the
patient becomes gradually sugar free. On successive days advances
can be made from Test Diet 1 to Test Diet 5, and if on the fifth day
the patient is not sugar free, fasting can be employed for one or
more days.</p>

<p>The Maintenance Diets are for use so soon as the urine of the
patient is free from sugar. If this occurs as a result of Test Diet 5
the patient begins with Maintenance Diet C1PF1. The actual articles
of food representing the carbohydrate in the diet for the first day are
given under the heading of carbohydrate, for convenience described
C1, 2, 3, etc. The articles referred to under protein and fat are under
that heading, which for the same reason is described as PF1, 2, 3, etc.
Certain cases of diabetes can proceed steadily day by day from
C1PF1 to C12PF12, without showing sugar. If sugar does appear in
the urine, drop back two days in the carbohydrate group, wait till
sugar free, then advance in the protein and fat group until sufficient
calories are obtained. Thus, if sugar shows on C7PF7 the diet prescribed
would be that included in C5PF7 and thereafter progression
could be made in the PF group until twenty-five to thirty calories per
kilogram body weight were furnished the patient.</p>

<p>Occasionally the patient becomes sugar free on Test Diet 2, 3,
or 4. It is then unnecessary to begin with Maintenance Diet C1PF1,
but instead with a maintenance diet which contains a value for carbohydrate
similar to that of the test diet upon which the patient became
sugar free.</p>

<p>If the protein and fat are too high for the individual on a given
day it is easy to advance the carbohydrate and decrease to an earlier
day on protein and fat.</p>

<p>The plan is arbitrary and the majority of cases will demand some
modification. It is arranged to enable patient or nurse to see in
advance the general plan of treatment.</p>

If the case is a mild one, this may be sufficient to free the
urine from sugar, but the diet is given primarily to enable
the physician to find out by means of urinalysis just how
great is the functional impairment.</p>

<p>In some cases, which are mild in character, the urine is
made free of both sugar and acetone without further dietetic
measures. However, when a severe diabetes is manifested
and a high percentage of glucose and in some cases acetone
bodies are found in the urine a more rigid treatment will be
found necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Preliminary Diet.</strong>&mdash;Many physicians find it advisable,
as has already been stated, to cut down the food allowance
before stopping it entirely. In the Michael Reese Hospital
this is done by first giving a practically fat-free diet, followed
by one or two days in which three or four eggs, 250
to 300 grams (8 or 10 ounces) of 5% vegetables are given,
after which it is found safe to institute the starvation treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Menus.</strong>&mdash;The following menus are given to
illustrate the dietetic treatment which it is deemed advisable
to institute in cases where the starvation treatment cannot
be given at once:</p>

<p>After the test diet of forty-eight hours, the following
r&eacute;gime is instituted:</p>

<h3>FAST</h3>

<p><strong>Method of Administering Treatment.</strong>&mdash;In many cases
the patient is first put to bed during the starvation treatment,
but recently Dr. Allen has emphasized the value of
exercise, claiming that it assists in utilizing the sugar. In
any case, the starvation r&eacute;gime remains the same. The
patient is given only coffee or clear broth with or without
whisky (one ounce every two hours) and the treatment continued
from one to four days, or until the urine becomes
sugar free.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>It has rarely been found necessary to continue the fast
longer than four days, since in most cases the sugar decreases
rapidly upon the discontinuance of food.</p>

<p><strong>Loss of Weight.</strong>&mdash;The slight loss of weight, which may
be noticeable as the result of starvation, is not undesirable,
especially in those cases where obesity is a prominent feature.
In fact care must be exercised in the follow-up treatment
to prevent the taking on of weight by the diabetic
individual, since, according to Allen, it is often found that
even moderately obese patients (180 lb.) continue to excrete
a small amount of sugar so long as they hold this
weight, even upon a low carbohydrate diet, whereas those
same patients show no difficulty in becoming sugar free if
the weight is reduced by ten or fifteen pounds.</p>


<h3>SCHEDULE FOR TREATMENT AND METHODS OF DETERMINING
FOOD TOLERANCES</h3>

<p>A number of schedules have been devised to enable the
nurse successfully to carry out the Allen Treatment. In
following out this treatment and re&euml;ducating the organs
afterward to tolerate foods which they have been unable to
handle on account of the impairment of the sugar-making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>380]</a></span>
organs, it is necessary to make a series of tests whereby the
diet is gradually increased in its various constituents until
the diabetic patient is able to handle a reasonable amount
of carbohydrates as well as other foods which have given
more or less trouble in the past.</p>

<p>The following schedule, after Joslin,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> is included, and a
careful study of it is advised in order that the nurse may
intelligently carry out the Allen Treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Schedule.</strong>&mdash;Fasting in many cases begins at once and
the patient experiences no ill effects from it. However, in
severe, long-standing cases many patients do better if the
fats are omitted at once and the rest of the diet left unchanged
for two days. Then the proteins in the diet are
omitted and the carbohydrates cut in half. This halving
of the carbohydrates is continued daily until only 10 grams
remain, after which they too are omitted. The fast is thus
made complete and remains so until the urine is entirely free
from sugar.</p>

<p><strong>Carbohydrate Tolerance</strong> is determined by giving, as
soon as the urine has been sugar-free for twenty-four hours,
150 grams of 5% vegetables. This is equivalent to from 8
to 10 grams of carbohydrates. After this 5 grams of carbohydrates,
or 75 grams of 5% vegetables, are added daily to
the diet until the patient is taking 20 grams. Then the addition
of 5 grams of carbohydrates is made every other day,
using the fruits and vegetables belonging to the 10% and
15% carbohydrate group, until potatoes and oatmeal and
finally bread can be tolerated unless sugar appears in the
urine before this or the tolerance reaches 3 grams to each
kilogram of body weight or, in other words, until a man
weighing 150 pounds is consuming 225 grams of carbohydrates
per day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>381]</a></span>
<strong>Protein Tolerance.</strong>&mdash;In making the test for the protein
tolerance it is necessary to wait until the urine has been
sugar free for forty-eight hours; 20 grams of protein is then
given. This is equivalent to 3 eggs, and daily additions of
5 grams protein are made, usually in the form of meat, until
the patient is receiving 1 gram of protein to every kilogram
of his body weight per day unless his carbohydrate tolerance
is zero, in which case it is wise to add only three-fourths of a
gram of protein per day.</p>

<p><strong>Fat Tolerance.</strong>&mdash;A determination of the fat tolerance
is made coincidently with that of the protein. No additional
fat is allowed until the protein tolerance reaches 1
gram per kilogram of body weight, unless the patient&rsquo;s
tolerance for protein is less than that. After which 25 grams
of fat per day are added until there is no further loss of
weight, taking care never to allow more than 40 calories per
kilogram of body weight.</p>

<p><strong>Reappearance of Sugar.</strong>&mdash;Should the urine again show
the presence of sugar, another period of fasting lasting for
twenty-four hours, or until the urine is again sugar free,
must be instituted. After the second fast the increase in the
diet may be twice as rapid as used after the first fast. However,
it is not advisable to increase the amount of carbohydrates
to more than half of that determined by the former
tolerance for a period of two weeks, during which time the
urine has been entirely sugar free, then the increase is made
more slowly and the amount given should not exceed 5
grams a week.</p>

<p><strong>Weekly Fast Days.</strong>&mdash;One day in seven should be set
aside by the diabetic patient for fasting, when the carbohydrate
tolerance is less than 20 grams. When, however, the
tolerance is between 20 and 50 grams of carbohydrates, the
patient may take one-half of his daily allowance of protein
and fat and a certain amount of 5% vegetables as well upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>382]</a></span>
the weekly fast day. When the tolerance reaches between
50 and 100 grams per day, vegetables of a higher carbohydrate
content may also be included. If the carbohydrate
tolerance should exceed 100 grams per day, the carbohydrates
upon the fast day may be simply half of the amount
allowed upon other days.</p>

<p><strong>The Giving of Alkalies.</strong>&mdash;If acidosis is evident, as may
be indicated by an excretion of diacetic acid, oxybutyric
acid, or acetone in the urine, alkalies may be given. Bicarbonate
of soda may be given in doses of 2 grams every 3
hours, as suggested by Hill and Eckman,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> but this is not as a
rule necessary, for, as Jacobi aptly remarks: &ldquo;Prevention is
the treatment of acidosis in children, and those susceptible
to acidosis should not have fat.&rdquo; What he has said for children
holds good for adults. However, it is likewise true that
fat must constitute a large part of a diabetic diet and the
only way to prevent it poisoning, is to raise the fat in the
diet gradually until the tolerance is determined.</p>

<p><strong>Determining the Extent of Acidosis.</strong>&mdash;It will be remembered
that in an earlier chapter it was found that the
excretion of ammonia in the urine to a certain extent indicated
the extent of the acidosis in the body, that is, if the
ammonia output exceeds three or four grams a day (twenty-four
hours), the extent of the acidosis is considerable, while
if it falls below that amount it is not alarming. More exact
methods, however, for the determining of the severity of
the acidosis will be found in another part of this text, where
the test for sugar and the acetone bodies will be explained in
detail.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The patient is placed upon a vegetable
diet consisting of vegetables containing not more
than five per cent. carbohydrate.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> These vegetables have
their carbohydrate content still further reduced by changing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>383]</a></span>
the water in which they are cooked three times. In many
cases this will reduce their content as much as one-half.</p>

<p>A small amount of fat usually in the form of butter is
allowed with these vegetables. The amount of 5% vegetables
given must be carefully adjusted since the patient
might readily take too much if allowed to follow the dictates
of his appetite.</p>

<p>The carbohydrate intake during the first one or two days
must be limited to 15 grams. This allows about 10 grams
of protein, 7 grams of fat, and 15 grams of carbohydrates.
Tea or coffee, without sugar or cream, may be given at each
of the three meals.</p>

<p>The following table is included, showing the various
foods arranged according to their carbohydrate content:</p>

<p>A departure from the now almost universally used &ldquo;Allen-Joslin
Starvation Diet,&rdquo; is seen in the &ldquo;Newburg-Marsh
High Fat Diet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The use of a high fat diet in the treatment of diabetes
is based primarily on one fact&mdash;namely, that if the food
eaten is not sufficient for the needs of metabolism, the body
itself supplies the deficiency. Fat is used as long as it lasts,
body protein being drawn upon for fuel when this is exhausted.
It is of distinct advantage to the patient to have
a diet of sufficient fuel value to run his body machine and
permit him a moderate degree of exercise. For by this means
he is not obliged to use his own body substance to carry on
metabolic processes. We thereby avoid the condition of extreme
emaciation (though it is to be emphasized that gain
in weight is to be carefully guarded against) with its constant
lowering of the general health.</p>

<p>The system of feeding consists of a series of four diets,
examples and standards of which are given below. The diet
is made up of protein on the basis of approximately &#8532; of a
gram per kilogram of body weight at the time the patient
leaves the hospital, a quantity of carbohydrate known to be
well tolerated and the balance of the calories in fat.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<strong>Nurse&rsquo;s Directions for Collecting and Testing the
Urine in Diabetes Mellitus.</strong>&mdash;The first urine voided in the
morning at 7 <small>A.M.</small> should be thrown away, after which the
entire quantity during the ensuing twenty-four hours, including
that at 7 <small>A.M.</small> the following morning, should be collected
in a thoroughly clean, wide-mouth bottle sufficiently
large to contain the entire quantity. This should be kept
in a cool place to prevent decomposition. After the urine
has been measured, four or five ounces are removed for
testing purposes. There is no necessity for having an
elaborately equipped laboratory for making the simple tests
of the diabetic urine. The nurse is only required to make
the simple tests, leaving the more elaborate one for the
physician. The articles necessary for these tests must be
kept perfectly clean in order to make the tests accurate.
The bottle in which the urine is collected must be washed
and sterilized daily before the collection begins. One small
three-inch white enameled or porcelain dish, one 10 c.c.
graduated pipette, 6 test tubes, 1 small alcohol lamp or
Bunsen burner, 1 box of sodium carbonate, 1 box talcum,
and the reagents necessary for making the test, namely,
Benedict&rsquo;s solution, Fehling&rsquo;s solution, and Haines&rsquo;s solution.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p><strong>Diabetes Mellitus</strong> is a disease in which the body becomes
more or less unable to utilize the sugars and starches, consequently
there is an abnormal amount of glucose in the
urine.</p>

<p><strong>Manufacture of Sugar</strong> in the body from other food constituents
besides carbohydrates has been proved with regard
to proteins, hence the intake of nitrogenous substances
must be restricted in diabetes&mdash;to a less extent, however,
than the sugars and starches.</p>

<p><strong>Acetone Bodies.</strong>&mdash;Diacetic acid, oxybutyric acid, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>402]</a></span>
acetone develop in diabetes as a result of the breaking down
of the fats and the lack of certain neutralizing agents found
chiefly in carbohydrate foods.</p>

<p><strong>Acidosis</strong> is a form of intoxication due to the retention
of these toxic acids in the body. If not combated and
overcome, it will result in the diabetic coma which is fatal
in so many cases.</p>

<p><strong>Diet Treatments.</strong>&mdash;The best known treatments are
those devised and used by Drs. Allen and Joslin &ldquo;The Starvation
Treatment for Diabetes Mellitus,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;High
Fat Diet&rdquo; formulated by Drs. Newburg and Marsh. All
cases cannot be handled alike and it is for the physician
to determine the treatment calculated to give the best
results in the definite case.</p>

<p><strong>Training for Diabetic Nursing.</strong>&mdash;So much depends
upon the administration of the treatment in this pathological
condition that in many hospitals special training is
being given to the nurses in the care of diabetic patients
that they may be able intelligently to carry out the necessary
r&eacute;gime, both in the hospital and in private practice.</p>

<p><strong>Symptoms.</strong>&mdash;She must be able to recognize symptoms
both from the findings resulting from the urinalysis and
from those manifested otherwise by the patient.</p>

<p><strong>The Record.</strong>&mdash;She must keep an absolute record of all
that occurs during the course of treatment and instantly
report any unusual happening.</p>

<p><strong>Urine Tests.</strong>&mdash;It is advisable to make the tests in the
morning; those for sugar and diacetic acid should be made
every day or, in some cases, every other day, as directed by
the physician, and those for ammonia and albumen about
once a week.</p>

<p><strong>Weighing the Patient.</strong>&mdash;Patient should be weighed
each day before breakfast, and the weight of the clothes
also carefully recorded separately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>403]</a></span>
<strong>The Bowels</strong> must move daily, even if it is necessary to
resort to mild laxatives or an enema.</p>

<p><strong>Formulating and Calculating the Dietary.</strong>&mdash;The
menus of the day must be formulated and the chemical
composition and nutrient value of the foods calculated.
The vegetables belonging to the five per cent. group should
be in readiness and the amount to be used weighed after
they have been boiled in clean, separate water to reduce
their carbohydrate content still further.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial Diabetic Foods.</strong>&mdash;It may be well to mention
the danger of putting faith in the so-called diabetic
foods so widely advertised. Some of these foods are of
undoubted worth, but it is never safe for the nurse or the
patient to judge of the merits of the various diabetic foods
without first knowing their chemical composition, and not
even then without the definite directions from the physician.</p>

<p><strong>Diabetic Flours.</strong>&mdash;The diabetic flours used in the recipes
included in this text have been approved by some of
the leading specialists in diabetes in this country, but the
nurse should not include them in the diet for her patient
unless they are prescribed by the physician in charge.</p>

<br />
DISEASES OF THE LIVER</h2>


<p>Much of the so-called biliousness from which the human
family is so prone to suffer is nothing more or less
than one of Nature&rsquo;s danger signals by means of which man
may understand that some part of the delicate organism
called the human body is being overworked. Close investigation
of these conditions has proved that it is the liver
which has been overtaxed, in many cases to such an extent
that in a measure it slows down, as any overtaxed machine
will do, and has become clogged with material which, owing
to its condition, it is not able to prepare properly and send
out on time.</p>

<p><strong>Work of the Liver.</strong>&mdash;When one considers the vast
amount of work performed by this organ, one marvels that
so little trouble is manifested. In another part of this text
the functions of the liver were defined. It was found to be
the largest secretory organ in the body, producing a constant
supply of bile by means of which the fats were dissolved
and the digestion and absorption of the other food
materials facilitated. We likewise found that the greater
part of the fuel foods was transformed within this organ
into available energy, either for immediate or future use.</p>

<p><strong>As a Detoxifying Agent.</strong>&mdash;To the liver must also be
credited the detoxifying of the various poisons produced
within the body during the process of metabolism or brought
in by way of food. Too much cannot be said as to the value
of the liver in this respect, the importance of which is made
known as soon as anything happens to the organ to put it
even temporarily out of commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>405]</a></span>
<strong>Causes of Liver Disorders.</strong>&mdash;Is it any wonder, then,
that with such abuses as overeating and drinking, especially
of those foods rich in fats and carbohydrates which depend
upon the liver for their availability in the body, Nature
cries aloud for help and for the comparative rest of this,
her largest organ?</p>

<p>The taking of alcohol in excess has been found to bring
about tissue changes in the liver. Hence it must be avoided
by individuals with a tendency to biliousness or to any disease
in which the liver is involved.</p>

<p><strong>The Bowels.</strong>&mdash;The bowels are as a rule constipated, and
one of the first means of relief is the overcoming of this
condition. The method of doing this depends upon the individual,
and the treatment must be decided on by the physician.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The dietetic treatment consists
in abstaining from food or reducing the amount to a minimum
while the attack lasts and while the intestines are
being thoroughly emptied. All stagnant material which
has clogged the bowels and which has been subjected to the
activities of putrefactive bacteria must be gotten rid of.
The diet must be especially low in fat. Oyster or clam
broth, soft-cooked eggs, toast, cereal, or rice, with a little
milk instead of cream and very little sugar, tea, and baked
apple or stewed prunes are given.</p>

<p><strong>Convalescent Diet.</strong>&mdash;After the attack the diet may be
gradually increased until it is again normal. Moderation
must be observed in the amount of food eaten; no highly
seasoned or spiced foods, pickles, or condiments, such as
peppers, mustard, or horseradish, should be taken. Salads
should be dressed without oil. Lean beef, lamb chops, fish,
chicken, sweetbreads, quail, squab, eggs (except fried or
hard cooked), green vegetables (except radishes, onions,
water-cress, and celery) in abundance, a small amount of
potato, rice, or tapioca, fresh and cooked fruit with little, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>406]</a></span>
any sugar, junket, custards, fruit jellies, weak tea and coffee
should constitute the diet. Certain individuals find that
milk increases the tendency to constipation; this is probably
due to the small amount taken; large quantities do
not as a rule produce this effect. Buttermilk, koumiss, and
modified milk are advised in severe cases.</p>

<p><strong>Diet for Constipation.</strong>&mdash;Individuals inclined to biliousness
should endeavor to overcome the constipation which is
one of the most prominent features. This is done by
proper diet more successfully than by drugs (cathartics):
bran bread, vegetable soup, fresh fruit, stewed fruit, fruit
beverages, plenty of water. The following menus are suggested:</p>

<p><strong>Advice to Patient.</strong>&mdash;The above menus are merely suggested.
The diet may be selected from the list of foods
already mentioned. The patient must be warned against
overeating and drinking. Pastry, rich cakes and puddings,
confectionery, gravies, etc., must be avoided. In certain
individuals beer will induce a bilious attack. By them it
should be avoided.</p>


<h3>CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER</h3>

<p>The cause of this disease and the stage in which it exists
must determine the treatment necessary. However, it matters
not what produced the disease, whether it is the result
of alcoholism, syphilis, etc., the diet plays an important
r&ocirc;le in its cure.</p>

<p><strong>The Diet.</strong>&mdash;The diet in this disease, as in any other,
must be determined by the condition of the patient. Unfortunately,
many patients do not know of their condition
until the disease is well advanced and symptoms of obstruction
are prominent. A study of these must be made before
the diet can be formulated. When the symptoms are
mainly those arising from disturbed digestion of the
stomach and intestines, without kidney or heart complication,
the diet for chronic gastritis is used.</p>

<p><strong>Restricting the Fluids.</strong>&mdash;When the heart is involved, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>408]</a></span>
is sometimes found necessary to restrict the fluids (dry diet)
to 1 quart (about 1000 c.c.) per day. The Karell Cure has
been used advantageously in many of these cases. In cases
where the kidneys are involved, the diet will depend upon
the condition of these organs.</p>

<p><strong>Restricting the Diet.</strong>&mdash;The diet in any case must be
restricted. Individuals with a tendency to cirrhosis and
those coming of a family in which liver diseases are frequent
should be especially warned about the dangers of overeating
and drinking. Alcohol should be avoided especially by such
individuals. They should keep their diet simple in character
and moderate in amounts.</p>

<p><strong>Avoidable Foods.</strong>&mdash;All foods, such as condiments and
spices, meat extracts, the outside browned portions of
roasted meat, alcoholic beverages, which exert a stimulating
or irritating effect upon the liver, should be studiously
avoided and the fats and carbohydrates restricted, since, as
it has already been demonstrated, it is upon the liver that
the body depends for the preparation of these substances
for their utilization. When, for example, the flow of bile
is lessened, an incomplete emulsification of the fats exists
and the fatty acids which are highly acid in character cannot
be efficiently dissolved or neutralized, or when the liver
is diseased and for this reason the conversion of glycogen
into glucose is interfered with, the utilization of the carbohydrate
foods is thus impaired.</p>


<h3>GALLSTONES</h3>

<p><strong>Factors Influencing Their Formation.</strong>&mdash;According to
Friedenwald and Ruhr&auml;h<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> the two factors that in all probability
exert the most influence on the formation of gallstones
are the stasis of bile and the inflammation of the
bile passages and gall bladder.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary Rules.</strong>&mdash;There are certain dietary rules which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>409]</a></span>
should be observed by all persons who have had gallstone
attacks. These are (1) to prevent stasis of bile, (2) to
avoid fats. Everything should be done to prevent the
formation of the stones, and this can only be accomplished
by observing these rules. The flow of bile must be free; this
is encouraged by keeping the intestinal tract in good condition.</p>

<p><strong>Stimulating Peristalsis.</strong>&mdash;Peristalsis must not be allowed
to become sluggish, for it is only during the process
of digestion when the food mass passes along the intestinal
canal that there is an ejection of bile into the intestines.
When the passage is abnormally slow the bile is in a measure
dammed back with a formation of gallstones as a
result. The restriction of the fats has already been discussed
in another part of the chapter. It has been demonstrated
that these substances have a chemical influence
upon the formation of gallstones as well as upon the intestinal
stasis which leads to their formation.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;Hence the diet should be so directed
as to (1) increase the flow of bile, and (2) to avoid
all foods that are liable to cause indigestion which may
bring about putrefaction in the intestinal tract and a consequent
irritation and inflammation of the bile passages
and gall bladder.</p>

<p>The meals should be regular and an abundant diet
advised to increase the flow of bile and stimulate peristalsis
in the intestines.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise.</strong>&mdash;Exercise is especially recommended. Horseback
riding, swimming, rowing, golf, and tennis are especially
valuable in forcing the bile from the gall bladder and
liver.</p>

<p><strong>The Clothing.</strong>&mdash;The clothing should be loose enough to
be perfectly comfortable. Certain cases of gallstone attacks
in women have been said to have been traced to tight lacing,
which interfered with the normal flow of the bile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>410]</a></span>
<strong>The Bowels.</strong>&mdash;Constipation should be avoided, and the
diet should be directed with this point in view. The meals
must be frequent, ranging from four to six a day. In this
way only is the flow of bile encouraged. The breakfast
should be ample in order to utilize the bile secreted in the
night season. With all this, care must be observed not to
give more food than can be adequately handled by the
digestive apparatus, since food which is not digested becomes
a prey to the actions of the putrefactive bacteria
which infest it, and the toxic substance thus formed produces
the very result which all of our efforts are directed to
prevent.</p>

<p><strong>Available Foods.</strong>&mdash;The following foods low in fats
may be used in formulating the diet:</p>

<p>Soups: Meat broth (made from lean meat) from which
all the fat has been removed.</p>

<p>Meats: Lean beef, lamb, chicken, squab, quail, lean fish
(in small quantities and not too frequently).</p>

<p>Green vegetables: Except peas and carrots; beets and
turnips may be taken sparingly.</p>

<p>Fruits: Oranges, lemons, grapefruit, and unsweetened
stewed fruit.</p>

<p>Cereals: Wheat cereals, oatmeal, rice, and tapioca in
moderation.</p>

<p>Bread: Whole wheat, white, rye, and graham bread,
toast, and crackers.</p>

<p>Fluids: Weak tea and coffee (without cream, and a little
sugar), orange and lemonade, mineral waters, water,
skimmed milk, whey.</p>

<p>Eggs: (except hard-cooked or fried).</p>

<p>Desserts: Fruit gelatin, fruit whips, raw or stewed fruit.</p>

<p>Avoid the following foods: Fats, oils, mutton, liver,
brains, sardines, and caviar, oily fish, rich gravies and sauces,
sweet fruit, peas, carrots, condiments and spices, pastry and
confectionery, pickles, alcoholic beverages. Restrict
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>411]</a></span>
carbohydrates, yolks of eggs, milk (cream must be skimmed off
if too rich).</p>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p><strong>Functions of Liver.</strong>&mdash;To transform fuel foods into
available energy; to detoxify those poisonous substances
produced as the result of metabolism of body tissue or
brought in in food, and to select those available for use; to
secrete bile.</p>

<p><strong>Factors Influencing Disorder of Liver.</strong>&mdash;Errors in
diet: (<i>a</i>) overeating; (<i>b</i>) excessive drinking; and (<i>c</i>) unbalanced
diet, especially as regards the amount of fats
and carbohydrates in the diet.</p>

<p><strong>The Bowels</strong>, in most of the disturbances affecting the
liver, become constipated, thus causing much additional
work on the part of the liver in handling the products produced
as the result of putrefactive bacteria upon the accumulated
mass in the colon.</p>

<p><strong>Tissue Changes</strong> in the liver have been caused by the
taking of alcohol, which should therefore be avoided by all
individuals having any disease involving the liver and by
those with a predisposition to liver disturbances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>414]</a></span>
<strong>Exercise and Lack of Exercise</strong> are potent factors in
the treatment of conditions involving the liver. First, because
the liver requires exercise to enable it to empty itself
more completely and assure a free flow of bile; second, because
exercise directly affects the energy output of the body,
causing an increased rate of metabolism and a better utilization
of the food ingested. Lack of exercise acts in
exactly the opposite direction, and it has been found that
with the majority of patients suffering from diseases of the
liver too little exercise and too much food are at the bottom
of the trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment</strong> in the majority of diseases affecting
the liver is much the same. The keynote in each is a balanced
diet. Constant overeating and excessive drinking
have proved the foundation of the majority of such diseases,
especially of the bilious type, while an excess of fat
and carbohydrates in the diet lead to the more serious disorders.</p>

<p><strong>Biliousness</strong> requires abstinence from food for a short
period and a cleansing of the entire gastro-intestinal tract,
the measures being directed by the physician. After the
bilious symptoms have subsided, a simple, well-regulated
diet should be established, in which no rich foods of any
sort are allowed. All condiments and spices which have an
astringent effect upon the bowels are strictly prohibited, and
alcoholic beverages had best be eliminated from the diet.</p>

<p><strong>Cirrhosis</strong> of the liver is apt to be insidious in its development,
taking a firm hold before the character of the disorder
is discovered. Dietetic treatment of this disturbance is
most important and should be directed toward overcoming
not only the liver symptoms but other symptoms as well.</p>

<p><strong>Gastro-intestinal Disturbances</strong>, manifested in cirrhosis
of the liver, are treated by the diet used in chronic gastritis
(see p. <a href="#Page_250">250</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Heart Symptoms</strong> sometimes occur during the course of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>415]</a></span>
the disease and require especial attention to the diet. The
fluids at times must be restricted, in which case a modification
of the Karell Cure will prove valuable (see p. <a href="#Page_342">342</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Kidney Complications</strong> develop in a certain percentage
of cases, and it then becomes necessary to institute one of
the various diets devised to meet the needs of those special
conditions (see Chapter <a href="#chap18">XVIII</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Restricting the Diet</strong> will be found to be necessary for
those individuals showing a tendency to cirrhosis, also for
those in whose family diseases of the liver are of frequent
occurrence. Such individuals should be warned of the dangers
arising from overindulgence in food or alcoholic beverages.</p>

<p><strong>Prohibited Foods</strong> are those which by reason of their
astringent qualities favor the development of constipation,
such as condiments and spices; those foods which exert a
stimulating and irritating effect upon the liver and bile
passages, such as alcohol, malt extractives, etc.; and fats
and carbohydrates in excessive quantities, on account of the
extra amount of work required of the liver in order to make
them available in the body.</p>

<p><strong>Gallstones</strong> develop as the result of inflammation or
clogging of the bile passages.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong> is dietetic in character and is directed toward
relieving or preventing inflammation in the bile passages,
also in stimulating the flow of bile in order that it may not
become sluggish and thus give rise to the development of
the gallstones.</p>

<p><strong>The Fats</strong>, therefore must be restricted in the diet, as
they, more than any of the other food constituents, favor
the above conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Peristalsis</strong> in the intestinal tract must be stimulated to
facilitate a free flow of bile, which will not occur where
the movements are sluggish. Stasis of the bile must be
prevented or stones will be apt to form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>416]</a></span>
<strong>Dietetic Treatment</strong> for gallstones is therefore directed
to increase the flow of bile and to avoid the inflammation
of the gall bladder and bile passages which may result from
the product of intestinal putrefaction.</p>

<p><strong>The Diet</strong> consists of foods simple in character, low in
fats, but abundant in quantity, in order to prevent constipation.
It must be selected carefully that digestional disturbances
may not develop.</p>

<p><strong>The Meals</strong> should be frequent, from four to six a day, in
order to encourage a free flow of bile.</p>

<p><strong>Breakfast</strong> should be ample in order that the bile secreted
and accumulated during the night may be utilized as soon
as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Constipation</strong> must be avoided, and the foods particularly
adapted to prevent or overcome this condition
should have a prominent place in the diet. Any accumulation
of unabsorbed food in the lower intestines becomes a
breeding ground for putrefactive bacteria, the product of
whose activity imposes a serious tax upon an already overworked
organ.</p>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<br />
GOUT, OBESITY, EMACIATION</h2>


<p>Gout is a constitutional disease characterized by an inflammatory
condition of the joints. It is caused by or
associated with a retention of uric acid in the blood. Gout
is also characterized by the deposit of uric acid or sodium
salts which occurs in different parts of the body, the joints,
the lobe of the ear, the knee and the elbow being common
points where the deposit of these salts ordinarily occurs.
The amount of uric acid is lessened in the urine in cases of
true gout, except in acute attacks, and in this way it is
distinguished from the so-called goutiness in which a urinalysis
shows an excess of uric acid. According to Strouse, this
excess of uric acid in the urine &ldquo;means a physical-chemical
change in the urine and is quite different from the small
amount usually excreted.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><strong>Source of Uric Acid.</strong>&mdash;In man the uric acid which is
eliminated in the urine is derived from two sources. It may
be taken with the body as purins in food, in which case it
is spoken of as being an &ldquo;exogenous&rdquo; product, or it may be
formed in the body from the breaking down of the nucleoproteins
(the highly nucleated cells of the glandular organs
particularly). When the uric acid is formed in this manner
as the result of the metabolism of the body tissues, it
is known as &ldquo;endogenous.&rdquo; In the normal body approximately
one-half of the uric acid formed is oxidized, while
the remaining half is eliminated from the body by way of
the urine.</p>

<p><strong>Elimination of Uric Acid.</strong>&mdash;In gout such is not the
case, the body loses to a certain extent the ability to eliminate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>418]</a></span>
the uric acid, hence it is retained within the body,
causing an excess in the blood stream, and it is this excess
uric acid in the blood which causes the acute attacks and
general pain and discomfort which inevitably occur in
chronic gout.</p>

<p><strong>Purin-bearing Foods as Sources of Uric Acid.</strong>&mdash;Formerly
no difference was made in food; all were supposed
to cause uric acid formation, but with the exhaustive investigation
of food materials this sweeping condemnation has
been to a great extent removed or narrowed down to a few
foods, those rich in purins being the chief offenders.</p>

<p><strong>Chief Causes of Gout.</strong>&mdash;Without a doubt, overeating,
overindulgence in alcoholic stimulation, lack of exercise, etc.,
are chiefly to blame for the large percentage of the cases,
but upon investigation it will be seen that those individuals
are as a rule large protein eaters and that their mode of
living is not such as to assist the body in throwing off the
poisons which form as the result of their self-indulgence.</p>

<p><strong>Rules to Combat Gout.</strong>&mdash;To successfully combat the
retention of a large percentage of uric acid in the blood
there are certain definite rules to be observed: (1) The general
diet must be reduced not only in amount but also in
purin-bearing foods; (2) All foods which are liable to cause
digestional disturbances, with the attending evils of intestinal
putrefaction and constipation, must be avoided.</p>

<p><strong>Alcohol in Gout.</strong>&mdash;If the patient is accustomed to
alcoholic stimulants and has been in the habit of taking
them constantly for years, the amount of alcohol consumed
daily must be radically reduced and only the amount prescribed
by the physician taken. Alcohol without a doubt
assists in the retention and increases the difficulty of uric
acid elimination by the body. In view of the present
knowledge of the cause and effect of uric acid in the body,
the treatment of gout is directed with the object of relieving
the condition (1) by facilitating the elimination of uric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>419]</a></span>
acid from the body, and (2) by so regulating the diet as to
exclude as far as possible those purin-bearing foods which,
by reason of their chemical composition, augment the general
amount of uric acid formed within the organism.</p>

<p>In gout, as in other abnormal conditions, no set rule
can be laid down to cover the treatment of every case. The
individual must be taken into consideration, his daily habits
studied and the extent and character of the disease known
before it is possible to prescribe a treatment or formulate a
diet which would adequately meet his needs under the
existing conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Obesity and Glycosuria.</strong>&mdash;Gouty individuals often become
obese and show evidences of glycosuria. Consequently
it is important to regulate the carbohydrates as well as the
purin-bearing foods in the diet. Only the simplest foods
are permissible. In acute attacks it has been found that
milk and alcohol cause less disturbance than meat and alcohol.
While the acute symptoms exist all meat should be
avoided and the daily allowance of alcohol cut down. Tea
and coffee both contain purins and should be avoided while
the acute stage of the disease continues. Cereal coffee, hot
water tea, hot milk or buttermilk may be substituted.</p>

<p><strong>Purin-free Diet.</strong>&mdash;A purin-free diet is advisable during
the acute attack. The following is a sample menu of such
a diet:</p>

<p>Purins are soluble in water, hence those foods that are
boiled contain less than those prepared by other methods
of cookery.</p>

<p><strong>Foods More or Less Condemned.</strong>&mdash;Salt has a tendency
to bring about a deposit of sodium urates in the body, and
for this reason should be sparingly used in the preparation
of the diet. Alkaline waters are inclined to produce a like
result, consequently should be avoided by the gouty individual.
Condiments and spices are conducive to constipation,
a condition to be avoided if possible under the circumstances.
Certain physicians prohibit the use of oranges
in the diet of gout, while others do not. Strawberries are
likewise condemned and should be eliminated from the diet
for both chronic and acute gout.</p>

<p><strong>Diet in Chronic Gout.</strong>&mdash;In chronic gout it is necessary
to maintain the general health of the patient by a well-balanced
diet. This is not difficult even if the dietary is
so regulated as to be well within the limits of his energy
requirements. It is necessary to limit the purin-bearing
foods. Meats are used sparingly and these should be boiled
rather than roasted or broiled. Eggs and cheese and milk
should be substituted for at least part of the regular allowance
of meat.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise and Massage.</strong>&mdash;The patient should be recommended
to take a certain amount of mild exercise in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>421]</a></span>
open air, or massage if he is accustomed to living an indoor
life or is confined to office work. He must be warned against
overindulgences of all kinds, especially of overeating and
drinking. A glass or two of hot water before breakfast is
recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment of Obesity.</strong>&mdash;The treatment of obesity
when occurring in gouty patients is much like that used in
other conditions. Ebstein regards obesity under such circumstances
as an unfavorable symptom. He advises a reduction
in the carbohydrates to the smallest possible
amount and allows meat and fats in the diet.</p>

<p><strong>Allowable Foods.</strong>&mdash;The following foods are practically
purin-free and may be used in the diet of gout:<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Milk,
cheese, butter, eggs, nuts, gelatin, fruits, sugar, breads made
with white flour, cereals, cream of wheat, farina, rice, hominy,
tapioca, cornstarch, potatoes and other root vegetables,
green vegetables, except asparagus, spinach, and all fats.</p>

<p><strong>Avoidable Foods.</strong>&mdash;The following foods are rich in
purins and should be avoided in the diet for gout: Sweetbreads,
liver, kidneys, beef, mutton, veal, pork, turkey,
chicken, goose, rabbit, duck and other game, fish, with the
exception of cod, sardines, and anchovies, tea, coffee, and
cocoa.</p>

<p>The following list shows the purin content of some of
the above-mentioned foods. The purins are computed by
Hall as follows: 1 kilogram contains,</p>

<h3>OBESITY</h3>

<p>Probably no one problem affecting the human family is
more widely discussed than that of obesity. There are
numberless &ldquo;cures&rdquo; suggested, most of which contain some
good, but they are as a rule more strenuous than the average
fat person cares to attempt, or, if attempted, persist in.</p>

<p><strong>Causes of Obesity.</strong>&mdash;It is stated that at least fifty per cent.
of the obesity is of hereditary origin, while the rest
may be due to overeating and drinking, unbalanced diets,
metabolic changes due to the approach of menopause in
women, and diseases such as gout in which there is a certain
amount of disturbance in the blood and excretory
organs and in which the diet or the disease may be accountable
for the gain of surplus adipose tissue. Women approaching
menopause may not change their diet in the
least and there may still be the noticeable increase of fat.</p>

<p><strong>Obesity Cures.</strong>&mdash;A great number of the &ldquo;cures&rdquo; are
undertaken not from a health standpoint but from the
esthetic point entirely. It makes no difference what reason
is brought forward for instituting the treatment, it is the
results which count. Of the cures undertaken which are in
themselves good, but which are too strenuous for the average
&ldquo;fat person&rdquo; to stick to may be mentioned some of the
early cures instituted and recommended by Banting, Oertel,
and Ebstein. Obesity, then, may be said to be due to (1)
heredity, (2) overeating and drinking, (3) lack of exercise
(sedentary life), (4) a combination of the above causes.
Whether the obesity is due to the lack of exercise or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>425]</a></span>
lack of exercise is due to the accumulation of fat which
causes a disinclination to move on the part of the individual,
can only be judged when a thorough examination
into the life and habits of the patient is made.</p>

<p><strong>Comparison of Food Intake and Energy Output.</strong>&mdash;Many
fat people who claim to be small eaters in reality
constantly consume more food than their age, weight, or
mode of living would necessitate. If such patients could
be prevailed upon to keep a correct chart of their daily
intake of food and the amount of exercise taken, they would
be astounded to find how much greater was the intake in
comparison to the output of energy, in other words, how
much more food they ate than they required to keep them
in health. A glance at the first tables in this text will show
which foods are utilized by the body chiefly as a source of
energy.</p>

<p><strong>Uses of Food in Body.</strong>&mdash;Physiological chemistry
proves that when more food is taken than is needed for
the internal and external work of the body, the surplus is
stored for future use, first, in the liver and muscles as glycogen
for the general expenditures, and, second, as adipose
tissue for future use. Thus it is seen that when the intake
is constantly greater than the energy expenditure there
must necessarily be some way in which the body can store
up the surplus fuel, and so long as the digestion remains
good and the amount of exercise limited there is no reason
why there should not be a constant and steady accumulation
of surplus fat which inevitably terminates in obesity.</p>

<p><strong>Water as a Fat Maker.</strong>&mdash;That water is in itself fattening
is of course untrue. A chemical analysis of this fluid
shows that it is inorganic in character and cannot alone
either produce energy or build tissue. However, this food
constituent plays a most important part in all the functions
of the body. In the first place the body cannot utilize food
unless it is in solution; water is also one of the best known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>426]</a></span>
stimuli to the flow of gastric juice, and for this reason is an
important factor in the preparation of the food for its absorption
and utilization; since water forms the bulk of the
blood, it acts as a distributor or carrier of food to the different
parts of the body.</p>

<p><strong>Limiting the Fluids in Obesity.</strong>&mdash;Thus it is seen that
when the intake of fluids is limited, the body will call upon
that surplus which is stored in every nerve, tissue, and fluid
throughout the entire organism to assist in the necessary
work of the organs, thus reducing the body weight just that
much.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise.</strong>&mdash;The athlete who is overweight, due to
adipose tissue, increases his exercise at times, even adding
to the weight of his clothing, causing an increased energy
output, profuse perspiration, etc., all of which causes the
body to use its surplus fuel in the form of the stored fat.
Exercise does not break down a muscle, it builds it up.
Thus many individuals who increase the strenuousness of
their exercise complain that their weight is increased even
when they observe a noticeable improvement in their general
feelings and appearance.</p>

<p><strong>The Appetite.</strong>&mdash;The great trouble with most women
who undertake an obesity cure which calls for an increased
amount of energy is that they will develop an increased
appetite thereby which they appease with food instead of
forcing the body to use the store in hand, thus entirely doing
away with any good the treatment might have accomplished.
No amount of exercise without a proper regulation
of the diet will prove satisfactory as far as the reduction of
fat is concerned. The following methods recommended by
Banting, Oertel, and Ebstein are included here.</p>


<h3>OBESITY DIETS AND CURES</h3>

<p><strong>Banting Method.</strong>&mdash;This method is said to be unsuited
to those with weak digestions. Following its use such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>427]</a></span>
individuals have been known to develop renal colic or gallstones;
constipation may be present and the entire system
may become so deranged as to render the patient liable to
disease.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p><strong>Banting Diet for Obesity.</strong>&mdash;Breakfast at 9 <small>A.M.</small>, consisting
of 5-6 ounces of animal food, meat or boiled fish
(except pork or veal), 1 small biscuit or 1 ounce dry toast.
Total solids, 5-6 ounces. Coffee or tea (without milk or
sugar), 9 ounces.</p>

<p>2 <small>P.M.</small>&mdash;Dinner: Fish or meat (salmon, eels, herring,
pork, and veal excepted), poultry or game; any vegetable
except potatoes, parsnips, carrots, turnips, or beet roots;
dry toast, 1 ounce; fruit cooked and unsweetened; good claret,
sherry, or Madeira, 10 ounces. Total solids, 10-12 ounces.</p>

<p>6 <small>P.M.</small>&mdash;Tea: 2-3 ounces cooked fruit; 1-2 ounces
rusks; 2-4 ounces solids; 9 ounces tea, without milk or sugar.</p>

<p>7 P.M.&mdash;Supper: Meat or fish as at dinner; claret or
sherry and water, 7 ounces.</p>

<p>Total daily solids, 21-27 ounces.</p>

<p>Total fluids, 35 ounces.</p>


<p class="hrpad">Oertel pointed out the great benefits which might be derived
by those individuals suffering from certain types of
heart disease which are accompanied by obesity. He made
it distinctly understood that while the treatment in no
way affected the heart lesion,&mdash;that is, in so far as altering
the character of the disease,&mdash;it greatly reduced the work
imposed upon the circulatory organ and permitted a more
complete oxidation of the blood.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p><strong>Oertel&rsquo;s Method.</strong>&mdash;Oertel bases his dietetic treatment
of obesity upon the heart changes and those which naturally
follow in the circulation. He makes the following suggestions,
taking always into consideration the condition of the
patient, whether he is anemic or plethoric.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>428]</a></span>
&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) Where there is an abnormally increased amount of
fat in plethoric patients with unimpaired or only beginning
changes in the heart action, the diet should aim at:</p>

<p>(1) An increased supply of protein.</p>

<p>(2) A decrease in the fat-forming substances.</p>

<p>(3) Little or no diminution in the supply of liquids below
the physiologic amount (1500 c.c.&mdash;3 pt.)</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Where there is obesity in anemic patients, viz. serious
plethora, the diet should aim at:</p>

<p>(1) An increase in the quantity of proteins.</p>

<p>(2) A diminution in amount of fat-forming substances
and eventually</p>

<p>(3) a decrease in the amount of fluid.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Where there is obesity in adults with anemic symptoms
in whom not only the amount of protein but also the
abnormally increased amount of fat is slowly wasting away,
they require:</p>

<p>(1) An increase in the amount of protein taken.</p>

<p>(2) A sufficient amount of fat and carbohydrates or
even an increase of same to prevent the falling off of fat.</p>

<p>(3) A diminution in the amount of fluid taken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oertel claims that the simplest method of reducing the
fat-forming elements in a diet is to decrease the amount of
fat and allow a certain amount of carbohydrates, regulating
the diet according to the individual. The following table is
given by him as showing the minimum and maximum
amount of the different food constituents constituting the
obesity diet:</p>

In instituting a treatment for obesity Oertel insists upon
a certain amount of exercise daily in the open air, the
amount to be regulated by the physician according to the
individual case. He suggests that five or six small meals a
day be given rather than a few large meals. He eliminates
soups, tea, and coffee while the cure is being given.</p>

<p><strong>Ebstein</strong> suggests a diet in which the carbohydrates and
fluids are reduced but in which the fats are allowed to a
considerable extent. The diet consists of meat, eggs, fish,
vegetables (green) and fruits. The following menu demonstrates
his dietary r&eacute;gime:</p>

<p>Breakfast: Large cup of tea (no milk or sugar); 2 oz.
bread with plenty of butter.</p>

<p>Dinner: Soup 4&frac12; to 5&frac12; oz.; meat with fat sauce; green
vegetables; fresh fruit; 2-3 glasses light wine.</p>

<p>Afternoon: Tea as at breakfast.</p>

<p>Supper: Tea, 1 egg, fat roast meat or ham, smoked fish;
about 1 oz. bread with plenty of butter; a little cheese and
fresh fruit; potatoes, sweets and sugars forbidden.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The following menus are suggested
by the author: The carbohydrates and fats are restricted
and the fluids reduced to a minimum. The meals
as far as possible are kept &ldquo;dry&rdquo;; soups, milk, cocoa are
avoided; water is not permitted at meals; alcoholic beverages,
white bread, butter, potatoes, sugar, candy, pastry,
cakes, puddings, gravies, sauces, bread dressings, griddle
cakes, sirups, molasses, honey, ice cream, cereals, pork of
all sorts, ham, bacon pork chops, etc., olive oil, spaghetti,
macaroni, and noodles are prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>Allowable Foods.</strong>&mdash;The following foods are allowed:
Black coffee or tea, small cup twice daily without milk,
cream, or sugar&mdash;saccharin may be used to sweeten if desired;
fresh or stewed fruit with the exception of bananas,
raisins, and dates, served without sugar; all green vegetables
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>430]</a></span>
cooked or served without butter or fat of any description;
salads, except potato or banana, served with a special dressing
(no oil or sugar); water ices; watermelon and other
melons served without sugar; 1 egg a day; gluten toast, no
butter; brown bread or muffins made with gluten flour and
prepared bran.</p>

<p><strong>Amount of Food.</strong>&mdash;The amount of food is limited to a
certain extent. Green vegetables may be eaten in abundance,
but the protein foods such as meat, fish and eggs
must be limited.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The bread (even gluten and bran breads)
must be limited to 1-2 slices at each meal. All meals are
eaten without fluids except breakfast, when one small cup
of coffee or tea without milk, cream, or sugar is allowed.
If fruit juice is to be served instead of fruit, it must be prepared
with little if any water and no sugar. The juice may
be poured over cracked ice, if desired.</p>

<p><strong>Rules and Regulations.</strong>&mdash;The following directions and
menus are given to be used when a reduction in weight is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>435]</a></span>
necessary. Care must be taken not to allow large amounts
of even the non-fat-forming foods in the dietary, since under
certain conditions the body will manufacture adipose tissue
of any surplus organic material ingested. Breakfast must
be limited as demonstrated in the tabulated diet sheet.</p>

<p><strong>Keeping the Weight Down.</strong>&mdash;After the individual has
been reduced to approximately the desired weight the diet
may be made a trifle more liberal, keeping in mind, however,
that moderation is the keynote in the obesity r&eacute;gime
and will have to be practised to a certain extent always. It
is wise to continue the dry meals and to limit the amount
of butter, cream, and other &ldquo;fatty foods,&rdquo; to a certain
extent. Pork, with the exception of crisp bacon several
times a week at breakfast, had best be avoided, and alcoholic
beverages should be omitted entirely except when prescribed
by the physician. The outdoor exercise should be
continued and only the amount of sleep requisite to health
indulged in. If the individual will faithfully carry out
these directions, there is no reason why the weight should
continue to be a burden. It must be remembered that it
is never safe to diet indiscriminately and without the advice
of a physician, since much harm may come of so doing.</p>

<p><strong>Value of Massage.</strong>&mdash;Massage is an advisable accompaniment
to an obesity diet and will help to prevent a sagging
of the tissues which have been deprived of the supporting
fat. The tissues of the face, neck, and breast are
especially apt to wrinkle unless given the exercise and
stimulation from massage. <strong>Cold baths</strong> are likewise advisable,
since they stimulate the body to burn up the fat.</p>

<h3>EMACIATION</h3>

<p>Emaciation as a rule is a symptom of an abnormal condition
rather than a disease in itself. Certain individuals
are said to be &ldquo;constitutionally thin&rdquo; and upon investigation
it is often found that this thinness extends back in
many cases for generations, many members of a family
being thin no matter what measures are taken to overcome
the condition. However, constitutional emaciation is not so
prevalent as constitutional obesity and, as has already been
stated, is more often a symptom of some metabolic disturbance
or pathological condition.</p>

<p><strong>Causes of Emaciation.</strong>&mdash;<strong>Errors in diet</strong>&mdash;insufficient
or improper food&mdash;are accountable for most of the cases
seen in infants and children. <strong>Over-exercise</strong>, that is, when
the amount of exercise taken is not commensurate with the
intake of food, is accountable for other cases. This type of
emaciation is found especially in growing children.</p>

<p><strong>Disease as a Cause.</strong>&mdash;Wasting diseases, such as tuberculosis
and anemia, bring about a loss of weight, while in
fevers in general and typhoid fever especially not only the
febrile condition hastens the metabolic processes but also
the activities of the bacteria act together and break down
the tissues of the body, causing a falling off from the normal
body weight. Loss of sleep, unhygienic or unsanitary
surroundings, and capricious appetites probably cause some
of the cases of excessive thinness.</p>

<p><strong>Thinness in Children.</strong>&mdash;Parents are to blame for much
of the thinness seen in children, especially the nervous high-strung
children whose energies outweigh their desire for
food or, as is more often the case, their willingness to eat
the proper foods. It is a mistaken kindness to cater to the
whims and fancies of a child&rsquo;s appetite, and much harm is
wrought by allowing the &ldquo;trash&rdquo; to overbalance the necessary
building or repair food in the dietary. Not that sugar
is not necessary, for it is particularly so at the age when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>439]</a></span>
the metabolic processes are faster than later in life, but it
must be remembered that the body is being built up both
in height and breadth.</p>

<p><strong>The Need for Building Foods.</strong>&mdash;The skeleton and the
muscular tissues cannot be constructed from sugar, hence
the diet which consists chiefly of this food constituent is
unbalanced and will sooner or later bring about disturbances
which are very apt to result in emaciation. <strong>The
causes of emaciation</strong> may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Those cases which are due to pathological conditions
such as tuberculosis, anemia, typhoid fever, etc.;</p>

<p>(2) Those induced by errors in diet and bad habits
such as insufficient or improper food, loss of sleep, over-exercise,
lack of ventilation in the sleeping apartment,
which destroys the appetite;</p>

<p>(3) Malformation or deformities of mouth, throat, or
stomach which make it impossible for the individual to
partake of sufficient food to cover the needs of the body;</p>

<p>(4) Heredity (&ldquo;constitutional thinness&rdquo;).</p>

<p><strong>Regulating the Diet.</strong>&mdash;As has been stated in a former
chapter, any persistent loss of weight or failure to gain on
the part of an infant whose chief business in life should be
to grow, should be given immediate and careful attention.
As a rule the diet is to blame; it is either improperly balanced,
insufficient in amount, or poorly prepared, any of
which might readily cause a disturbance to the delicate
apparatus of the child.</p>

<p><strong>Diet and Habits.</strong>&mdash;In adults, the diet and habits of
life are in many cases to blame for the excessive thinness
seen in many individuals. If the trouble can be traced to
some abnormal condition, it can only be removed by relieving
or checking the disease which induced it. The older
methods of treating typhoid fever, for example, did nothing
to prevent the progressive emaciation which was the result
not only of the accelerated metabolism from the fever but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>440]</a></span>
also from the invasion of the intestinal tract by the specific
bacteria which brought about a like result. In tuberculosis
a similar breaking down of the tissues occurs, as is likewise
the case in anemia and other diseases in which the functions
of the blood-making organs are interfered with. Any of the
above diseases may cause emaciation, and the treatment
in most of the cases resolves itself in removing the cause as
far as possible and in adjusting the diet.</p>

<p><strong>Selection of Food.</strong>&mdash;The dietetic treatment for emaciation
is practically the only one which will materially change
the weight of the individual, since by food alone is the
body built. Certain foods are more capable of being readily
converted into adipose tissue than others, and these must
have a prominent place in the dietary.</p>

<p><strong>Rules and Regulations.</strong>&mdash;In obesity it was found that
it was necessary to curtail the sleep and rest, increase the
amount of exercise and decrease the amount of food. In
emaciation practically an opposite r&eacute;gime is adopted. The
patient is urged to eat plenteously, drink copiously of
water and nutrient beverages, soup, etc., avoid worry and
excitement, over-exertion and indigestion, to take one or
two naps every day, to retire early, to avoid hot baths and
take a warm cleansing bath followed by a cold shower or
sponge bath. Exercise must be of a mild character; the
patient must be warned against becoming exhausted, since
this condition precludes a gain in weight.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The meals must be carefully selected,
well prepared and daintily served, that all of the
psychical benefits from such efforts may be attained. A
nutrient beverage such as cream, egg, and vichy, re&euml;nforced
fruit beverages, malted milk, with egg and chocolate,
cereal and milk gruels, etc., may be given between breakfast
and lunch, lunch and dinner and before retiring. The meals
must consist of the simplest foods that the digestion may
not be overtaxed by the quantity ingested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>441]</a></span>
<strong>Allowable Foods.</strong>&mdash;The following foods may be used
in the treatment of emaciation: All dairy products, milk,
cream, butter and cheese, eggs cooked in various ways,
soups of all kinds, meats in moderation, vegetables, especially
potatoes, olive oil, and the various salad oils, cereals,
tapioca, macaroni, spaghetti, noodles, rice, bread of every
description, fruit including bananas, grapes, dates, raisins,
prunes, etc., ice creams, farinaceous puddings, sauces, except
those containing vinegar, grape juice and other fruit
juices sweetened with sugar, cocoa and chocolate, malted
milk and proprietary infant foods, honey, molasses and
sirups, cakes, cookies and pastry in moderation. It is advisable
to make milk the chief fluid food; to this is added
cream, malted milk, lactose, eggs, and other re&euml;nforcing
agents.</p>

<p><strong>Milk Cure.</strong>&mdash;Certain physicians advise milk alone, giving
from one to two gallons a day for three weeks or longer.
Many individuals complain that &ldquo;milk makes them bilious&rdquo;
but, as a rule, this is because the amount taken is small and
the solids insufficient to lend the necessary bulk to the
feces, consequently the peristaltic action becomes sluggish
and the passage of the food mass delayed in the intestinal
tract, furnishing a medium for bacterial growth and activity.
When larger quantities are ingested such is not the case
and the fluid so high in nutrient qualities is utilized by the
body for the building up of the depleted tissues. When
the emaciation is the result of disease the diet is necessarily
adjusted to meet the condition. At times it is most difficult
to overcome the anemia and accompanying emaciation on
account of the disease precluding the giving of the foods
especially designed by nature to produce flesh. This is
especially the case in the progressive emaciation in diabetes.
However, in this case the Allen starvation treatment,
with the re&euml;ducation of the organs to a toleration for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>442]</a></span>
carbohydrates, has gone far toward overcoming this distressing
condition.</p>

<p><strong>Readjusting the Habits.</strong>&mdash;When the loss of weight is
found to be the result of close application to work, lack of
fresh air and sleep, or from errors in diet, a change of climate
and occupation should be made, together with a readjustment
of the daily habits, such as substituting a cool
bath for the regular hot one, and sleeping out of doors or
on a sleeping porch instead of in a poorly ventilated bedroom.</p>

<p>The patient must be urged to eat, regardless of appetite,
for in this way only can the body weight be increased. The
dietary must be made up largely of the fat-forming foods,
but not to such an extent as to upset the nitrogen equilibrium.</p>

<p>The following diet sheet is given to be used as a guide
in the treatment of emaciation. Other foods of a similar
composition and fuel value may be substituted for those
given here, to vary the diet.</p>

<strong>Methods of Increasing the Diet.</strong>&mdash;The above diet furnishes
three times as much food as is needed to maintain
the body living a sedentary life, or about as much as would
be needed to maintain a lumberman at hard outdoor labor
in the Maine woods. It would be impossible for an ordinary
individual to handle such an abundant diet without
making the increase in the diet gradually. This is best
done by adding the milk and cream at the end of each meal
and a glass of milk between meals and at bedtime, then
gradually adding the fattening foods already mentioned until
the diet approximates the diet sheet here computed.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<h4>GOUT</h4>

<p>Gout is a constitutional disease characterized by an inflammatory
condition of the joints.</p>

<p><strong>The Joints</strong> are the seat of chalky deposits of uric acid or
sodium salts.</p>

<p><strong>Metabolism</strong> in gout is disturbed, with a consequent retention
instead of elimination of uric acid by the body.</p>

<p><strong>The Blood</strong> contains an excess of uric acid which increases
greatly during an acute attack.</p>

<p><strong>The Urine</strong> in true gout does not contain an excess of
uric acid except during an acute attack, whereas in the so-called
goutiness there is a constant excess of this acid.</p>

<p><strong>Uric Acid</strong> is produced as the result of the metabolism in
the human body of the nucleoproteins and in food of the
purin bodies.</p>

<p><strong>Alcohol</strong> undoubtedly assists in the retention and increases
the difficulty of uric acid elimination by the body.</p>

<p><strong>Chief Causes of Gout.</strong>&mdash;Overeating, excessive alcoholism,
and too little exercise, especially in the open air.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong> consists in regulating the diet both as to the
quantity and type of food eaten; reducing or eliminating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>445]</a></span>
the alcohol in the dietary, and increasing the amount of
outdoor exercise.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The best results are obtained by
reducing the size of the meals and avoiding the purin-bearing
foods as far as possible. Eggs are purin-free and may
be substituted for much of the meat in the diet. In chronic
gout it is impossible to eliminate meat entirely from the
diet, but the quantity can be materially reduced and that
which is eaten may be rendered less harmful if it is boiled
instead of roasted or broiled, as in this way much of the
purin is dissolved out. Highly spiced and seasoned foods,
rich gravies, etc., are apt to cause an acute attack and
should be omitted. Excesses of all kinds must be avoided
to enable the patient to live a fairly comfortable life, free
from frequent painful attacks of gout.</p>


<h4>OBESITY</h4>

<p><strong>Causes.</strong>&mdash;Heredity, overeating, unbalanced diet, chronic
alcoholism, and disturbed metabolism, as manifested in gout
and other pathological conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Cures</strong> are more or less of a risk, except when undertaken
upon the advice and under the care of a competent
physician. As a rule they are too strenuous to be carried
out alone and are of no good unless persisted in. Among
the best known obesity cures may be mentioned those formulated
by Banting, Oertel and Ebstein.</p>

<p>Most physicians have their own methods of treating
obesity, but all are based primarily on diet and exercise.</p>

<p><strong>Food</strong> is the chief cause of obesity and since some foods
are more readily converted into adipose tissue than others,
it is necessary to understand the behavior and functions
of the various food combinations in the body before it is
possible to say which are the offending articles of diet.</p>

<p><strong>Water</strong> has no fattening properties of its own. This is
proved by a glance at its chemical composition, but as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>446]</a></span>
acts as a distributor and carrier of food to the various parts
of the body and since the bulk of all the secretions is composed
of water and every tissue in the body stores this
fluid, thus adding to the weight, a consideration of the
intake of water for obesity patients is most essential.</p>

<p><strong>Appetite</strong> requires attention. The majority of obese
patients eat more than their energy output calls for, consequently
it is necessary to curb the appetite and increase the
energy output in order to utilize the material on hand in
the form of adipose tissue.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong> is absolutely essential in order to force the body
to burn up its surplus fat as fuel. The best form of exercise
is that which is taken out of doors. The well-worked muscle
is heavier than one which is unaccustomed to exercise. The
latter is infiltrated with fat and weighs less than muscular
tissue, but a muscular body can endure more than one which
is covered with adipose tissue.</p>

<p><strong>The Heart</strong> of obese patients becomes more or less
affected as obesity advances and it becomes absolutely necessary
in many cases to get rid of some of the surplus fat
in order that the patient may live. This is best accomplished
by dietetic treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Circulatory Changes</strong> likewise occur as the heart becomes
affected, making it necessary to institute some dietary measures
at once.</p>

<p><strong>Glycosuria</strong> in obese patients suffering from gout is not
at all unusual and to relieve this condition the carbohydrates
in the diet must be at once reduced.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment</strong> is most important. It constitutes
the only rational method of ridding the body of its surplus
fat. To do this it is necessary to regulate the diet both as
to quantity and type. Fat-forming foods are those which
the body utilizes most easily for the production and storage
of fat. Any food, no matter whether it is fat-forming or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>447]</a></span>
not, if taken greatly in excess of the needs of the body, will
be stored as adipose tissue.</p>

<p><strong>Chief Points</strong> to be remembered in formulating a diet
and instituting an obesity treatment are the necessity for
<em>small meals</em> and <em>dry meals</em>, no fluid given at all during the
meal except perhaps one or two small cups of coffee per
day, without sugar or cream, the avoidance of fat-forming
foods, sugars and starches in all forms, milk, cream, butter
and oil, potatoes, bananas, fat meats of all descriptions,
especially pork, soups of every description and alcoholic or
malted beverages. It is necessary to limit the amount of
sleep, prohibiting naps during the day, and to increase the
amount of outdoor exercise.</p>

<p><strong>Massage</strong> is advisable, especially in those patients who
are unable, on account of their excessive weight or heart
symptoms, to take the requisite amount of exercise necessary
for their future welfare. Massage likewise makes the
muscles firmer, often preventing the disfiguring sagging of
the skin caused by depriving it of its padding of fat.</p>


<h4>EMACIATION</h4>

<p><strong>Causes.</strong>&mdash;Errors in diet, overwork, over-exercise,
heredity, nervousness, worry, malformation of the mouth,
throat, or stomach, heredity and certain pathological conditions,
such as typhoid fever, tuberculosis, anemia, dysentery,
etc., in which the breaking down of the tissues occurs
more rapidly than they can be rebuilt.</p>

<p><strong>Children</strong> are often emaciated on account of their unbalanced
diet. They receive an insufficient amount of building
food to cover their growth and development requirements.
Parents are often to blame for allowing the child to overeat
of some of the food constituents at the expense of others.
Sugar, for example, is very necessary in the diet of a growing
active child, but all sugar and very little milk and eggs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>448]</a></span>
will lead to an unbalanced diet which may bring about a
condition of extreme thinness later on.</p>

<p>In <strong>Adults</strong> the constant eating of the wrong foods, overworking
and persistent worrying, all contribute to the breaking
down of the tissues which ends in emaciation.</p>

<p><strong>Weight</strong> is an index to health. Any persistent loss of
weight on the part of an adult or loss or even failure to
gain in a growing child, are indications that all is not right
and immediate measures must be taken to locate and relieve
the trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Loss of Weight</strong> due to pathological conditions can only
be relieved by removing the cause, after which the diet may
be adjusted to suit the condition.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment</strong> is practically the only means of
combating and overcoming emaciation, since it is by food
alone that the body is built.</p>

<p>Fat-forming foods, which in obesity were prohibited,
have a prominent place in the diet for emaciation. Padding
the nerves and organs with a layer or covering of fat protects
them from the jars and shocks incidental to daily life,
besides lending grace and contour to the body.</p>

<p><strong>Foods Which Produce Fat</strong> are nutrient beverages of all
sorts; milk, malted milk and cream are especially valuable;
water, because of its particular properties and functions in
the body; and fruit beverages, which are made chiefly of
water and sugar, are always included in the dietary. Milk
and cream, soups and milk gruels, as well as all dishes made
with milk or cream, add materially to the fat-forming
quality of the diet. Butter, olive and other salad oils, as
well as cereals, potatoes, bread and simple desserts are advised.
The diet must be bountiful, the meals frequent, and
lunches consisting of milk or cream with crackers will hasten
the gain in weight.</p>

<p><strong>Rest</strong>, preferably lying down, is absolutely essential. A
period of relaxation covering from fifteen to thirty minutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>449]</a></span>
should be taken before or after each meal. The body derives
the use of the food for the storage of fat which would
otherwise be required to cover its energy expenditures.</p>

<p><strong>Sleep</strong> is essential to gain, consequently the patient
should retire early and take one or two naps during the day.</p>

<p><strong>Baths</strong> should be warm, not hot, followed by a cold
shower or sponge.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong> must be mild in character; over-exertion precludes
a gain in weight and exhaustion undermines the
forces which make it possible for the body to store fat as
adipose tissue.</p>

<p><strong>Nervous Excitement and Worry</strong> must be avoided.</p>

<p><strong>Gastro-intestinal Disturbances</strong> should be guarded
against, since all the pounds gained through months of
treatment may be quickly lost during one acute attack of
diarrhea or auto-intoxication.</p>

<p><strong>Massage</strong> is advised. The kneading and gentle manipulation
of the muscles stimulates them to utilize more food
material, besides enabling the patient to eat more by reason
of an increased appetite.</p>

<p><strong>The Milk Cure</strong> has been used extensively in overcoming
extreme emaciation. It consists in the taking of large quantities,
ranging from one to two gallons per day. It is given
every hour or oftener for a period of one month to six
weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Re&euml;nforcing the Diet</strong> with eggs and lactose is often
found of great value in increasing the weight quickly, as is
the giving of one-third of a glass of cream and two-thirds
of a glass of milk after each meal and at bedtime. The
whole scheme of putting on pounds resolves itself into the
giving of proper food in larger quantities than are ordinarily
given, but dividing it up into frequent meals in order not
to upset the digestion and do away with the good already
accomplished.</p>

OTHER CONDITIONS MORE OR LESS AFFECTED
BY DIET</h2>

<h3>PTOMAINE POISONING, ACIDOSIS AND PELLAGRA</h3>

<h4>PTOMAINE POISONING</h4>


<p>The poisoning due to ptomaine is very similar to that
brought about by overeating and other dietetic errors.
However, it is not so easy to avoid being poisoned by ptomaines
as it is to observe moderation in the quantity of
food eaten.</p>

<p><strong>Origin.</strong>&mdash;These substances are believed to be of an
infective bacterial origin and may be present in foods which
are otherwise seemingly fresh and good. The fact that they
cannot be detected in food without an analysis makes them
more of a menace than they would otherwise be, for any
substance which is not discernible to our senses, the taste,
sight, or smell, and which exerts a baleful influence, such
as ptomaine, cannot be anything but a menace to humanity.</p>

<p><strong>Infected Food Materials.</strong>&mdash;We may congratulate ourselves
in the knowledge that these substances are not present
in many foods, and if we avoid eating nitrogenous materials,
which may have become polluted, either through
imperfect canning or by standing in unclean vessels, we
may avoid much of the poisoning which may otherwise be
due to the action of ptomaines.</p>

<p><strong>Chicken Salad and Ice Cream Poisoning.</strong>&mdash;Certain
violent attacks of so-called ptomaine poisoning may be
traced to chicken salad which has been allowed to stand
overnight in tin receptacles or to ice cream which has melted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>452]</a></span>
and been re-frozen. In any case the treatment remains the
same.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The patient is put to bed and the intestinal
tract cleansed by means of enemas and in many cases
purgatives (salts, castor oil, etc.) as directed by physician.</p>

<p>The symptoms usually present in those suffering from
ptomaine poisoning are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, pain
more or less violent in character, and prostration which is
at times alarming.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The treatment instituted under
the circumstances is very much the same as that used in
other forms of acute poisoning. All food is withheld for a
period; the duration of this starvation must necessarily
depend upon the condition of the patient, the violence of
the poison and the extent of the prostration.</p>

<p><strong>Rectal Feeding.</strong>&mdash;When the prostration is great, it is
sometimes necessary to give saline enemas and even rectal
alimentation to prevent collapse.</p>

<p><strong>Fluid Diet.</strong>&mdash;After the violent attack subsides, the patient
is placed upon a fluid diet similar to that used in auto-intoxication
and practically the same as the diet for acute
infectious diseases. The diet must be gradually increased
until it becomes normal and the nurse must remember that
the patient is in a condition to suffer a relapse with the least
indiscretion. It is advisable to have a thorough investigation
made to ascertain the source of the original attack,
that the patient may be able to avoid future trouble from
partaking of the same food.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Idiosyncrasies.</strong>&mdash;It may be that there is a
personal idiosyncrasy against one particular food, and in
this case it becomes more or less of a simple matter to prevent
future attacks. Certain individuals are, for example,
invariably poisoned by eating shellfish, others manifest a
similar idiosyncrasy against strawberries. Thus is the old
proverb demonstrated: &ldquo;What is one man&rsquo;s meat is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>453]</a></span>
another man&rsquo;s poison.&rdquo; And he who wantonly flies in the
face of the danger signals Nature provides for his guidance
must necessarily suffer the consequences of his folly.</p>

<p>It has been proved with certain individuals that the
foods that at one time cause an attack of poison at another
time may be eaten with impunity. Thus it would seem to
remain a question not so much of the type of poison, ptomaines,
etc., as the amount of resistance manifested at the
time by the individual partaking of the infected food.</p>


<h4>ACIDOSIS</h4>

<p><strong>Metabolism of Fats.</strong>&mdash;Acidosis is a condition believed
to be due primarily to some impairment in the metabolism
of fat in the body, in consequence of which there is an
accumulation of substances more or less irritating and at
times toxic in character in the blood. These substances,
known as acetone bodies, are especially apt to appear in
the urine of individuals suffering from diabetes, likewise in
those undergoing starvation, whether as a result of treatment
to overcome a definite pathological condition, as in
diabetes, or as the result of disease itself.</p>

<p><strong>Malnutrition as a Source.</strong>&mdash;Certain individuals, children
especially, develop symptoms of acidosis under many
different circumstances; for example, in many cases of malnutrition
the evidences of acidosis are almost invariable.
The treatment in these cases must be, of course, prompt in
order that the condition may not assume a serious aspect.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The diet is adjusted in order to
neutralize the effect of the acid in the blood. This is done
in two ways: first, by reducing the fat, and second, by increasing
the amount of base-forming foods in the diet.</p>

<p>The following table<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> illustrates the foods in which the
acid-forming elements and base-forming elements predominate:</p>

<p>The fruits likewise show a predominance of base-forming
elements over acid-forming elements and for this reason
may be used to balance the diet.</p>

<p><strong>Diabetic Acidosis.</strong>&mdash;The acidosis during diabetes has
been already discussed in the chapter devoted to that disease.</p>

<p>It has been found advisable in the majority of cases of
acidosis to restrict the fat in the diet of all patients who,
during the course of a disease, have given evidence of this
condition; at the same time it is well to remember that fat
is one of the essential food constituents and absolutely necessary
to the welfare of the individual, consequently it is
impossible to eliminate it from the diet entirely. The only
feasible method, then, to pursue under the circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>455]</a></span>
is to restrict the fats in the diet so long as there are symptoms
of acidosis and to add them gradually and in very small
amounts until the individual&rsquo;s tolerance for fats is determined.</p>

<p><strong>Balancing the Diet.</strong>&mdash;In many cases of acidosis due to
starvation, no matter what the cause, the diet must be necessarily
regulated and properly balanced. It would be
decidedly unwise to attempt to build up the body by giving
building foods alone, without due consideration to the foods
containing the agents provided by Nature to neutralize the
acid formed during the process of their metabolism. It is
readily seen in the table just given that meat and eggs
show a marked excess of acid-forming elements, whereas
vegetables and fruits yield an excess of base-forming elements.
With these data, it becomes more simple to balance
the diet and to avoid the acidosis which may arise from impairment
of the fat metabolism of the body.</p>


<h4>PELLAGRA</h4>

<p>The enormous increase in the number of cases of pellagra
in America during the last twenty years makes it necessary
for something to be done to arrest its progress. The
cause of this disease is still under discussion, but much has
been done to find out definitely the reason for the tremendous
increase in the number of cases, especially in the
Southern States, where the increase has been most noticeable.</p>

<p><strong>Cause.</strong>&mdash;This disease has been the subject of much
study and discussion in this country in recent years.
Voegtlin, in an article published in a Report of the United
States Public Health Service (Reprint 597 of Public Health
Report), summarizes the current findings on pellagra as
follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;1. The hypothesis that there is a causal relation between
pellagra and a restricted vegetable diet has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>456]</a></span>
substantiated by direct proof to this effect and has led to results
of considerable practical and scientific value.</p>

<p>&ldquo;2. The metabolism in pellagra shows certain definite
changes from the normal, which point to decreased gastric
secretion and increased intestinal putrefaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;3. In the treatment and prevention of pellagra, diet is
the essential factor. The disease can be prevented by an
appropriate change in the diet without changing other sanitary
conditions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;4. A diet of the composition used by the pellagrins
prior to their attack by the disease leads to malnutrition
and certain pathological changes in animals, resembling
those found in pellagra. A typical pellagrous dermatitis
has not been observed in animals. Pellagrous symptoms
have been produced in man by the continued consumption
of a restricted vegetable diet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;5. The nature of the dietary effect has not been discovered,
although certain observations point to a combined
deficiency in some of the recognized dietary factors as the
cause of the pellagrous syndrome.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment.</strong>&mdash;The diet in pellagra is one which
is well balanced in all its particulars, and one in which the
proteins are carefully adjusted as to type. The best results
have been observed on diets in which the complete proteins
(milk, meat and eggs) have a prominent place. As a rule,
in the diet of an adult suffering from pellagra, at least forty
grams (about 60 per cent) of the necessary proteins should
be in this form. The diet for pellagra must necessarily be such
as to overcome as far as possible the progressive emaciation
which is an important symptom. However, it must be
kept in mind that gastro-intestinal disturbances are likewise
prominent and that diarrhea is often most difficult to overcome.
For these reasons it is essential to formulate a diet
which will not interfere with the treatment for the disease,
and which will be at the same time one on which the patient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>457]</a></span>
can gradually be built up, and in this way benefit, as far
as possible, under the circumstances. The diet used in the
treatment of anemia seems to be the one best suited to
meet the requirements of the patient suffering with pellagra;
changes may be made in this diet, however, by the
physician, who will be able to judge the need of the individual
under his care. Whether pellagra can be cured by
dietetic treatment is very uncertain, but the condition of
the patient can undoubtedly be materially improved, provided
the treatment is begun sufficiently early; that is,
before the disease has progressed to such an extent that
neither diet nor anything else can bring about a cure.</p>

<p>The above dietetic treatment is not claimed to be infallible.
It is merely given as a suggestion to be used at the
discretion of the physician.</p>

<p>In all probability the treatment of pellagra will undergo
a definite change in the near future, but at present our best
results accrue from the giving of an adequate, well-balanced
diet. The extent of the relief of such dietetic measures
depends, as has already been stated, upon taking the
disease in its early stage.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p><strong>Food Poisoning</strong> is more or less common, being induced
by polluted water, milk, or other foods, bad sanitation, and
imperfect canning, as well as by certain obscure substances
known as ptomaines.</p>

<p><strong>Shellfish</strong> have often been found to cause poisoning in
certain individuals. Stale fish may cause the most violent
type of poisoning in any individual.</p>

<p><strong>Chicken Salad</strong> which has been kept overnight in tin
receptacles has been known to cause violent attacks of
poisoning.</p>

<p><strong>Ice Cream</strong> which is melted and re-frozen is likewise a
source of a number of the cases reported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>458]</a></span>
<strong>Symptoms.</strong>&mdash;Very like those of auto-intoxication, and
violent intestinal disturbances are manifested.</p>

<p><strong>Prostration</strong> may be great, according to the violence and
duration of the attack.</p>

<p><strong>Anemia</strong> follows many cases of poisoning as a result not
only of the impairment and lack of nutrition of the blood-making
organs, but also on account of the other symptoms,
especially diarrhea occurring in the disease.</p>


<h4>ACIDOSIS</h4>

<p>This condition is more or less common, especially in the
disturbances manifested by children.</p>

<p><strong>Cause</strong> of acidosis is believed to be an impairment of
metabolism, especially in regard to the fats.</p>

<p><strong>Starvation or Malnutrition</strong> is believed to produce many
cases of acidosis in childhood and adults suffering from diseases
in which certain foods have been limited.</p>

<p><strong>Dietetic Treatment</strong> like that used in acute gastro-intestinal
disturbances begins with a starvation period and is followed
by a simple fluid diet until violent symptoms subside.
Examination of the stools and the material vomited will,
at times, furnish an insight as to the source of the poison.</p>

<p><strong>Convalescent Diet</strong> is begun after the violent symptoms
have subsided, but care must be taken not to increase the
diet too rapidly, owing to the danger from relapse.</p>

<p><strong>Method of Administering Diet.</strong>&mdash;First: a period of
total abstinence from food.</p>

<p>Second: fluid diet consisting of broth, buttermilk, or
some of the predigested liquid beef preparations which furnish
both food and stimulation necessary in such cases.</p>

<p><strong>Rectal Feeding</strong> may be found necessary when the prostration
is great.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Idiosyncrasies</strong> should be taken into account
and effort made to find whether or not the attack is caused
by any one food material or by bad sanitation or unclean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>459]</a></span>
food. The patient should be warned against the danger of
taking a food which has caused a previous attack of poisoning,
especially in cases where a personal idiosyncrasy against
a food has been manifested.</p>


<h4>PELLAGRA</h4>

<p>The cause and cure for this disease are still a matter of
discussion. Whether it is due to the presence or absence of
certain substances in the food materials, is as yet to be
determined.</p>

<p><strong>Diet in Pellagra</strong> is most important. It is impossible to
say that pellagra is a nutritional disease, but it is certain
that in balancing the diet much has been done toward relieving
the condition.</p>

<p><strong>Diarrhea</strong> is one of the chief symptoms of the disease and
great care is needed in formulating the dietary in order not
to increase this condition.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong>&mdash;The diet is thus shown to be directed
toward overcoming the emaciation and anemia and relieving
or preventing the gastro-intestinal disturbances which are
so apt to occur. It must be remembered that even a well-balanced
diet will not materially relieve the condition unless
it is instituted sufficiently early.</p>

<h2><a name="table4" id="table4"></a>TABLE IV</h2>

<h3 class="smcap">Composition and Fuel Value of Most of the Foods Used in the Invalid Dietary</h3>

<p>All determinations allow 28.35 grams to the ounce.</p>

<p>All calculations are made using the factor 4 calories for protein, 4 calories
for carbohydrates, and 9 calories for fats.</p>

<p>The materials are measured in standard 8-ounce measuring cups, or
tablespoons. The measures are exactly level unless otherwise stated. In
calculating beverages containing alcohol, it is necessary to know the percentage
of alcohol contained therein. Alcohol has a fuel value of 7 calories
per gram. (Whether this heat is available for the needs of the body is still
a question.)</p>

<p>Instructions for use: To determine the &ldquo;pelidisi,&rdquo; locate in the
left-hand column the child&rsquo;s sitting height in centimeters. With a
ruler follow the weights in kilograms to the right until the proper
figure is reached. Trace upward in that column to the heavy figure
at the top, which indicates the pelidisi.</p>

<h3><a name="pelidisi" id="pelidisi"></a>THE NUTRITIONAL INDEX&mdash;THE &ldquo;PELIDISI&rdquo;</h3>


<p>Pirquet believes that the sitting height is a basis for the
more accurate estimation of the nutritional state than is the
standing height. It was demonstrated that the cube of the
sitting height in centimeters is approximately ten times the
weight in grams of the normal person. With this formula
in mind, it becomes easy to compute the nutritional state
in percentages, when the sitting height and the weight are
known. The formula would read:</p>

<div class="figcenter hrpad hrpadb" style="width: 285px;">
<img src="images/dfn04.png" width="285" height="45"
alt="10 times the weight divided by sitting height cubed equals 100 per cent" />
</div>

<p class="center">or</p>

<div class="figcenter hrpad hrpadb" style="width: 329px;">
<img src="images/dfn05.png" width="329" height="48"
alt="The cube root of 10 times the height divided by sitting height equals 100 per cent" />

<p><b>Transcriber's Note</b></p>

<p>Minor punctuation errors have been repaired. Hyphenation and accent
usage has been made consistent.</p>

<p>There are some errors in calculation in places; these have been preserved
as printed. For example, addition errors in the table on pp. <a href="#Page_377">377-8</a>.</p>

<p>Variable spelling is preserved as printed (e.g. sirup and syrup).</p>

<p>12 M. has been used inconsistently, to indicate either 12 Midnight or
12 Midday. It has been preserved as printed in all cases.</p>

<p>Calorie count or separate ingredients lists are omitted from some recipes;
these are left as printed.</p>

<p>The 'Eggs' section, starting on page <a href="#Page_95">95</a>, has no recipes included.
However, the following 'Fruit Beverages' section has a large number of
egg recipes included in it. Whether this was an error or intentional
is unclear, so the sections and ordering of recipes have been
preserved as they appeared in the original publication.</p>

<p>The recipe for Foamy Sauce appears twice, once each on page <a href="#Page_111">111</a> and
<a href="#Page_112">112</a>. There is no apparent difference apart from the calorie amount.
Both versions have been left in place.</p>

<p>The recipe for Sauce for Puddings (page <a href="#Page_112">112</a>) appears identical to the
recipe for Wine or Fruit Sauce (page <a href="#Page_111">111</a>), except for the recipe name
and calorie amounts. Both versions have been left in place.</p>

<p>The table heading on page <a href="#Page_117">117</a> refers to cuts of lamb and mutton, while
the table itself refers to lamb and veal. This has been left as printed.</p>

<p>There are two instances of a recipe called Beef Juice, on pages <a href="#Page_119">119</a> and
<a href="#Page_141">141</a>. Both have been left in place as printed.</p>

<p>The following amendments have been made:</p>
